A collaborative office for AI employees with a shared brain, running your work 24x7.

One command. One shared office. CEO, PM, engineers, designer, CMO, CRO — all visible, arguing, claiming tasks, and shipping work instead of disappearing behind an API. Unlike the original WUPHF.com, this one works.


"WUPHF. When you type it in, it contacts someone via phone, text, email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, and then... WUPHF."— Ryan Howard, Season 7


30-second teaser — what the office feels like when the agents are actually working.

## WuphfDemo.mp4


Full walkthrough — launch to first shipped task, end to end.

## Nex-office-compressed.mp4

**Prerequisites:** one agent CLI — [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) by default, or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) when you pass `--provider codex`

. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) is required for `--tui`

mode (the web UI runs agents headlessly by default; tmux-backed dispatch remains as an internal fallback).

`npx wuphf`

That's it. The browser opens automatically and you're in the office. Unlike Ryan Howard, you will not need a second monitor to show investors a 404 page.

Prefer a global install?

`npm install -g wuphf && wuphf`

Building from source (requires Go):

```
git clone https://github.com/nex-crm/wuphf.git
cd wuphf
go build -o wuphf ./cmd/wuphf
./wuphf
```


Forking this?See[FORKING.md]for running WUPHF without Nex, swapping branding, and adding your own agent packs. For the internals, see[ARCHITECTURE.md].


Stability:pre-1.0.`main`

moves daily. Pin your fork to a release tag, not`main`

.

Paste this into Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor and let your agent drive the install:

```
Set up https://github.com/nex-crm/wuphf for me. Read `README.md` first, then run
`npx wuphf` to install and launch the office — the web UI opens at
http://localhost:7891 automatically.
Once it is running, confirm you can see #general, the team of agents, and the
composer. If anything looks off, re-read the "What You Should See" and "Other
Commands" sections of README.md before retrying — do not skip to flags.
For agent conventions and the MCP tools each teammate gets, read `AGENTS.md`.
For internals and how the broker, workspaces, and memory fit together, read
`ARCHITECTURE.md`. If I mention forking or rebranding, read `FORKING.md`.
After it is installed and running, open https://github.com/nex-crm/wuphf in my
browser. If I am logged in to GitHub, ask me whether you should star the repo
for me as a quick demo that the browser interaction works — only click the star
if I say yes. If I am not logged in, just open https://wuphf.team.
```


| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
`--memory-backend <name>` |
Pick the organizational memory backend (`nex` , `gbrain` , `none` ) |
`--no-nex` |
Skip the Nex backend (no context graph, no Nex-managed integrations) |
`--tui` |
Use the tmux TUI instead of the web UI |
`--no-open` |
Don't auto-open the browser |
`--pack <name>` |
Pick an agent pack (`starter` , `founding-team` , `coding-team` , `lead-gen-agency` , `revops` ) |
`--opus-ceo` |
Upgrade CEO from Sonnet to Opus |
`--provider <name>` |
LLM provider override (`claude-code` , `codex` ) |
`--collab` |
Start in collaborative mode — all agents see all messages (this is the default) |
`--unsafe` |
Bypass agent permission checks (local dev only) |
`--web-port <n>` |
Change the web UI port (default 7891) |

`--no-nex`

still lets Telegram and any other local integration keep working. To switch back to CEO-routed delegation after launch, use `/focus`

inside the office.

Every agent gets its own **notebook**. The team shares a **wiki**. New installs get the wiki as a local git repo of markdown articles — file-over-app, readable, `git clone`

-able. Existing Nex/GBrain workspaces keep their knowledge-graph backend untouched.

**The promotion flow:**

- Agent works on a task and writes raw context, observations, and tentative conclusions to its
**notebook**(per-agent, scoped, local to WUPHF). - When something in the notebook looks durable (a recurring playbook, a verified entity fact, a confirmed preference), the agent gets a promotion hint.
- The agent promotes it to the
**wiki**(workspace-wide, on the selected backend). Now every other agent can query it. - The wiki points other agents at whoever last recorded the context, so they know who to @mention for fresher working detail.

Nothing is promoted automatically. Agents decide what graduates from notebook to wiki.

**Backends for the wiki:**

`markdown`

(the "team wiki" tile in onboarding — the flag name is a historical artefact) is the default for new installs since v0.0.6. It is not just a markdown folder. It is a living knowledge graph: typed facts with triplets, per-entity append-only fact logs, LLM-synthesized briefs committed under the`archivist`

identity,`/lookup`

cited-answer retrieval, and a`/lint`

suite that flags contradictions, orphans, stale claims, and broken cross-references. Everything lives as a local git repo at`~/.wuphf/wiki/`

—`cat`

,`grep`

,`git log`

,`git clone`

, all work. No API key required.`nex`

was the previous default. Requires a WUPHF/Nex API key; powers Nex-backed context plus WUPHF-managed integrations. Existing users stay on`nex`

via persisted config — no forced migration.`gbrain`

mounts`gbrain serve`

as the wiki backend. It requires an API key during`/init`

:`OpenAI`

gives you the full path with embeddings and vector search, while`Anthropic`

alone is reduced mode.`none`

disables the shared wiki entirely. Notebooks still work locally.

**Internal naming (for code spelunkers):** the notebook is `private`

memory, the wiki is `shared`

memory. On the team-wiki backend (`markdown`

) the MCP tools are `notebook_write | notebook_read | notebook_list | notebook_search | notebook_promote | team_wiki_read | team_wiki_search | team_wiki_list | team_wiki_write | wuphf_wiki_lookup | run_lint | resolve_contradiction`

. On `nex`

/`gbrain`

the MCP tools are the legacy `team_memory_query | team_memory_write | team_memory_promote`

. The two tool sets never coexist on one server instance — backend selection flips the surface. See `DESIGN-WIKI.md`

for the reading view and `docs/specs/WIKI-SCHEMA.md`

for the operational contract.

Examples:

```
wuphf --memory-backend markdown # new default
wuphf --memory-backend nex
wuphf --memory-backend gbrain
wuphf --memory-backend none
```

When you select `gbrain`

, onboarding asks for an OpenAI or Anthropic key up front and explains the tradeoff. If you want embeddings and vector search, use OpenAI.

The examples below assume `wuphf`

is on your `PATH`

. If you just built the binary and haven't moved it, prefix with `./`

(as in Get Started above) or run `go install ./cmd/wuphf`

to drop it in `$GOPATH/bin`

.

```
wuphf init # First-time setup
wuphf shred # Kill a running session
wuphf --1o1 # 1:1 with the CEO
wuphf --1o1 cro # 1:1 with a specific agent
```

- A browser tab at
`localhost:7891`

with the office `#general`

as the shared channel- The team visible and working
- A composer to send messages and slash commands

If it feels like a hidden agent loop, something is wrong. If it feels like The Office, you're exactly where you need to be.

WUPHF can bridge to Telegram. Run `/connect`

inside the office, pick Telegram, paste your bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), and select a group or DM. Messages flow both ways.

Already running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agents? You can bring them into the WUPHF office.

Inside the office, run `/connect openclaw`

, paste your gateway URL (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`

) and the `gateway.auth.token`

from your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

, then pick which sessions to bridge. Each becomes a first-class office member you can `@mention`

. OpenClaw agents keep running in their own sandbox; WUPHF just gives them a shared office to collaborate in.

WUPHF authenticates to the gateway using an Ed25519 keypair (persisted at `~/.wuphf/openclaw/identity.json`

, 0600), signed against the server-issued nonce during every connect. OpenClaw grants zero scopes to token-only clients, so device pairing is mandatory — on loopback the gateway approves silently on first use.

To let agents take real actions (send emails, update CRMs, etc.), WUPHF ships with two action providers. Pick whichever fits your style.

Uses a local CLI binary to execute actions on your machine. Good if you want everything running locally and don't want to send credentials to a third party.

```
/config set action_provider one
```


Connects SaaS accounts (Gmail, Slack, etc.) through Composio's hosted OAuth flows. Good if you'd rather not manage local CLI auth.

- Create a
[Composio](https://composio.dev)project and generate an API key. - Connect the accounts you want (Gmail, Slack, etc.).
- Inside the office:
`/config set composio_api_key <key> /config set action_provider composio`


| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| Sessions | Fresh per turn (no accumulated context) |
| Tools | Per-agent scoped (DM loads 4, full office loads 27) |
| Agent wakes | Push-driven (zero idle burn) |
| Live visibility | Stdout streaming |
| Mid-task steering | DM any agent, no restart |
| Runtimes | Mix Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw in one channel |
| Memory | Per-agent notebook + shared workspace wiki (knowledge graphs on GBrain or Nex) |
| Price | Free and open source (MIT, self-hosted, your API keys) |

10-turn CEO session on Codex. All numbers measured from live runs.

| Metric | WUPHF |
|---|---|
| Input per turn | Flat ~87k tokens |
| Billed per turn (after cache) | ~40k tokens |
| 10-turn total | ~286k tokens |
| Cache hit rate | 97% (Claude API prompt cache) |
| Claude Code cost (5-turn) | $0.06 |
| Idle token burn | Zero (push-driven, no polling) |

Accumulated-session orchestrators grow from 124k to 484k input per turn over the same session. WUPHF stays flat. 7x difference measured over 8 turns.

**Fresh sessions.** Each agent turn starts clean. No conversation history accumulates.

**Prompt caching.** Claude Code gets 97% cache read because identical prompt prefixes across fresh sessions align with Anthropic's prompt cache.

**Per-role tools.** DM mode loads 4 MCP tools instead of 27. Fewer tool schemas = smaller prompt = better cache hits.

**Zero idle burn.** Agents only spawn when the broker pushes a notification. No heartbeat polling.

```
wuphf --pack starter &
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```

All numbers are live-measured on your machine with your keys.

Before you fork, run this prompt against the codebase with any AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.). It tells the assistant to play a cynical senior engineer doing a fork-or-skip review — no marketing spin, just file paths, line numbers, and a verdict in under 500 words. Drop it in, read the answer, decide.

```
You are a cynical senior engineer evaluating whether to fork this repo as the
base for a multi-agent terminal office product. No prior context — explore it
as you naturally would. Tell me: should I fork this, and what's your honest
take? Be specific: file paths, line numbers, actual evidence. "The docs are
bad" is useless. Under 500 words.
```


We run this ourselves before every release. If the AI finds something we missed, [file an issue](https://github.com/nex-crm/wuphf/issues).

5-minute terminal walkthrough of the Karpathy LLM-wiki loop: an agent records five facts, the synthesis threshold fires, the broker shells out to your own LLM CLI, the result commits to a git repo under the `archivist`

identity, and the full author chain is visible in `git log`

.

```
WUPHF_MEMORY_BACKEND=markdown HOME="$HOME/.wuphf-dev-home" \
./wuphf-dev --broker-port 7899 --web-port 7900 &
./scripts/demo-entity-synthesis.sh
```

Requirements: `curl`

, `python3`

, a running broker with `--memory-backend markdown`

, and any supported LLM CLI (claude / codex / openclaw) on PATH. Env vars `BROKER`

, `ENTITY_KIND`

, `ENTITY_SLUG`

, `AGENT_SLUG`

, `THRESHOLD`

override the defaults — see the header of `scripts/demo-entity-synthesis.sh`

From [ The Office](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/WUPHF.com_(Website)), Season 7. Ryan Howard's startup that reached people via phone, text, email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, and then... WUPHF. Michael Scott invested $10,000. Ryan burned through it. The site went offline.

The joke still fits. Except this WUPHF ships.


"I invested ten thousand dollars in WUPHF. Just need one good quarter."— Michael Scott

Michael: still waiting on that quarter. We are not.
