*A ~9M parameter LLM that talks like a small fish.*


This project exists to show that training your own language model is not magic.No PhD required. No massive GPU cluster. One Colab notebook, 5 minutes, and you have a working LLM that you built from scratch — data generation, tokenizer, model architecture, training loop, and inference. If you can run a notebook, you can train a language model.It won't produce a billion-parameter model that writes essays. But it will show you exactly how every piece works — from raw text to trained weights to generated output — so the big models stop feeling like black boxes.


```
You> hi guppy
Guppy> hi there. i just found a nice spot near the rock. the temperature feels nice.
You> are you hungry
Guppy> yes. always yes. i will swim to the top right now. i promise to eat all of it.
You> do you like bubbles
Guppy> i love bubbles. they make the water feel slightly different.
You> what is the meaning of life
Guppy> food. the answer is always food.
You> tell me a joke
Guppy> what did the fish say when it hit the wall. dam.
You> do you love me
Guppy> you're my favorite big shape. my mouth are happy when you're here.
You> goodnight guppy
Guppy> ok sleep time. i was following a bubble but now i'll stop. goodnight tank. goodnight water.
```


GuppyLM is a tiny language model that pretends to be a fish named Guppy. It speaks in short, lowercase sentences about water, food, light, and tank life. It doesn't understand human abstractions like money, phones, or politics — and it's not trying to.

It's trained from scratch on 60K synthetic conversations across 60 topics, runs on a single GPU in ~5 minutes, and produces a model small enough to run in a browser.

Vanilla transformer. No GQA, no RoPE, no SwiGLU, no early exit. As simple as it gets.

Guppy:

- Speaks in short, lowercase sentences
- Experiences the world through water, temperature, light, vibrations, and food
- Doesn't understand human abstractions
- Is friendly, curious, and a little dumb
- Thinks about food a lot

**60 topics:** greetings, feelings, temperature, food, light, water, tank, noise, night, loneliness, bubbles, glass, reflection, breathing, swimming, colors, taste, plants, filter, algae, snails, scared, excited, bored, curious, happy, tired, outside, cats, rain, seasons, music, visitors, children, meaning of life, time, memory, dreams, size, future, past, name, weather, sleep, friends, jokes, fear, love, age, intelligence, health, singing, TV, and more.

Runs entirely in your browser via WebAssembly. Downloads a quantized ONNX model (~10 MB) and runs inference locally — no server, no API keys.

Downloads the pre-trained model from HuggingFace and lets you chat. Just run all cells.

**T4 GPU** **Run all cells**— downloads dataset, trains tokenizer, trains model, tests it- Upload to HuggingFace or download locally

```
pip install torch tokenizers
python -m guppylm chat
```

```
You> the cat is looking at you
Guppy> i hide behind the plant when the furry one comes.
You> it is raining outside
Guppy> i think rain is the best thing about outside.
```


In interactive chat mode, the conversation grows and quickly runs into the 128-token limit, reducing quality. You can also invoke chat with a single prompt, and exit after the response:

`python -m guppylm chat --prompt "tell me a joke"`

**Why no system prompt?** Every training sample had the same one. A 9M model can't conditionally follow instructions — the personality is baked into the weights. Removing it saves ~60 tokens per inference.

**Why single-turn only?** Multi-turn degraded at turn 3-4 due to the 128-token context window. A fish that forgets is on-brand, but garbled output isn't. Single-turn is reliable.

**Why vanilla transformer?** GQA, SwiGLU, RoPE, and early exit add complexity that doesn't help at 9M params. Standard attention + ReLU FFN + LayerNorm produces the same quality with simpler code.

**Why synthetic data?** A fish character with consistent personality needs consistent training data. Template composition with randomized components (30 tank objects, 17 food types, 25 activities) generates ~16K unique outputs from ~60 templates.
