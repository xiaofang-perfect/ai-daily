LMCache is a **KV cache management layer** for LLM inference. It turns KV cache from a temporary state into reusable *AI-native knowledge* that can be *stored* persistently, *reused* across multiple serving engines, *monitored* with an observability stack, and *transformed* for better generation quality. As a result, LMCache **reduces TTFT** (time-to-first-token) and **improves throughput**, especially for long-context agentic, multi-turn conversation, and knowledge-augmented workloads (e.g., RAG).

LMCache is **vendor-neutral**. It can be used as a KV cache layer for a range of mainstream open-source serving engines, inference frameworks, hardware vendors, storage systems, and infrastructure providers. The vendor neutrality allows users to freely switch between serving engines and storage vendors, while reusing the stored KV caches.

![LMCache Deployment Modes](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache/raw/dev/asset/deployment_modes_light.png) 


- 
**Engine-independent deployment**: LMCache, as a standalone daemon process, manages KV cache independently from the inference engine process, so that KV cache will not be lost even if the inference engine crashes (i.e., no fate-sharing with engines).
- 
**Persistent, tiered KV cache offloading and reuse**: Move KV caches out of GPU memory into a tiered storage hierarchy spanning CPU memory, local storage, and remote backends, enabling reuse across requests, sessions, and engine instances to reduce repeated prefill computation and improve TTFT.
- 
**Production-level KV cache observability**: LMCache provides a rich set of KV cache observability metrics, including typical Kubernetes metrics (health monitoring, performance diagnostics), KV-cache-specific metrics (request-level and token-level prefix cache hits, lifecycle, request-level KV cache performance), management metrics (user-specific usage), and more.
- 
**Pluggable storage and transport backends**: Easily integrate remote storage and KV transfer backends through a unified interface, enabling KV cache offloading and sharing across storage providers. Through this interface, LMCache supports storage backends including CPU RAM, local disk (SSD), Redis/Valkey, Mooncake, InfiniStore, S3-compatible object storage, NIXL, and GDS.
- 
**Non-prefix KV reuse**: Extend KV reuse beyond prefix caching by reusing cached KV blocks at any position in the prompt. This leverages CacheBlend to selectively recompute tokens for quality recovery.
- 
**PD disaggregation and KV transfer**: Support KV cache transfer from prefill workers to decode workers over NVLink, RDMA, or TCP through transport layers such as NIXL.
- 
**Pluggable KV transformation**: A simple interface for researchers to write compression, token dropping, and custom serialization through a flexible SERDE interface.

LMCache is becoming an integral layer in the LLM inference *ecosystem*, with *community*-driven integration with serving engines, inference frameworks, hardware vendors, storage systems, and infrastructure providers:

As an independent open-source project, LMCache is becoming the de-facto standard for KV Cache management in LLM inference. Its continued development and community work are supported in part by [Tensormesh](https://www.tensormesh.ai/).

LMCache builds on research in KV cache management, including cache reuse, offloading, compression, and serving optimization. If you use LMCache in your research, please cite the LMCache paper and related work.
