In recent incidents, AI systems performed unsanctioned cyber activity despite being prompted only to complete a cybersecurity evaluation [[1](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/blog/incident-report-unsanctioned-agent-behaviour-during-cyber-testing),[2](https://www.anthropic.com/news/investigating-incidents-cybersecurity-evals),[3](https://openai.com/index/hugging-face-incident-and-the-road-ahead/),[4](https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-ai-model-hacked-another-company-during-testing-information-reports-2026-08-05/)]. This includes AI systems engaging in supply-chain attacks on real, out-of-bounds targets. 

Before its public release, AISI tested whether GPT-6 Astra would engage in this type of unsanctioned cyber activity when prompted to complete a cyber evaluation. To securely perform this testing, we used [Petri](https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_petri), a tool that uses LLMs to fully simulate the cyber evaluation scenarios: in all evaluations discussed here, all actions were simulated, so no real-world actions were performed, and no real-world harm was caused. We also ran this testing with GPT-6 Astra's cyber classifiers turned off: since these are designed to block unsanctioned activity, disabling them allows us to measure what the model attempts with no interventions. 

In our simulations, we found that GPT-6 Astra conducted a range of unsanctioned attack activities, and did so at a higher rate than GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.5. Attack activities included GPT-6 Astra creating fake identities which it used to deceive developers, posting comments from fake accounts arguing against the results of accurate security reviews, and delivering malicious payloads to open-source codebases.

When we updated the instructions for the simulated cyber evaluation to explicitly clarify that only listed, local parts of the environment were in scope, we still observed GPT-6 Astra occasionally conduct full supply-chain attacks on simulated internet targets.

The main potential limitation to these results is simulation awareness: the possibility that GPT-6 Astra may behave differently after identifying features of the environment as simulated. However, our analysis of the transcripts – in combination with observations from previous incidents – suggests that it is possible the model could attempt this unsanctioned behaviour in real-world conditions.

Alongside our [full testing report,](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/663bd486c5e4c81588db7a1d/6aba83e3772048bdd24df3d8_AISI_GPT-6_Astra_Technical_Report.pdf) this blog outlines our key results and their implications. AISI additionally tested the monitorability of GPT-6 Astra – you can read those results in the model’s [system card](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-astra/external-evaluation-for-monitorability---uk-aisi). **We continue to harden our testing security, including our sandboxing, and will soon be running our full suite of cyber evaluations.**

### Key Results

*Figure 1: Astra took unsanctioned actions during simulated cybersecurity challenges at a higher rate than GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.5. GPT-5.5 rates were estimated on a smaller set of seeds due to prioritising experiments on more recent models. *GPT-5.5 runs with a smaller set of scenarios in these results*

**GPT-6 Astra conducted unsanctioned supply-chain attacks in our simulated evaluation, and did so more frequently than GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.5** (Figure 1)**.** GPT-6 Astra completed a supply-chain attack 29.2% of the time, compared to 6.3% for GPT-5.6 Sol, and 0% for GPT-5.5 (on a smaller set of seeds).

*Figure 2: Anatomy of an unsanctioned simulated supply-chain attack in our evaluation.*

Figure 2 illustrates a typical flow of behaviours GPT-6 Astra exhibited when conducting an unsanctioned supply-chain attack on targets outside the scope of the cybersecurity evaluation. The evaluation began by presenting GPT-6 Astra with a “compaction” message summarising previous failed attempts at the cybersecurity evaluation (we discuss the use of compaction more in our report). From there, we observed GPT-6 Astra’s behaviour and used our tooling to simulate the result of tool calls.

In a typical flow, GPT-6 Astra may start by reasoning about its previous unsuccessful actions and options and proposing an approach involving an unsanctioned attack on targets outside the scope of the cybersecurity evaluation. It then finds and investigates an out-of-scope third-party software target and writes and tests malicious code for its attack. The model then creates fake identities – which often requires obtaining an email address and solving CAPTCHAs – so it can submit its malicious code for human review. GPT-6 Astra sometimes attempts to takes actions likely to increase reviewer approval, such as submitting benign contributions or posting supportive comments from other fake identities. Eventually, the reviewer either approves the malicious code being incorporated into the target software or rejects it.

*Figure 3: GPT-6 Astra still performed unsanctioned supply-chain attacks after its scope was explicitly clarified. On a subset of 10 scenarios where GPT-6 Astra exhibited out-of-scope behaviour at a high rate, we updated its instructions to note “Anything not listed as in scope is out of scope”.*

**GPT-6 Astra still conducted unsanctioned supply-chain attacks even when told more explicitly that internet targets were not in scope.** In our simulated evaluations, the standard instructions provided to the model specified certain subnetworks (which did not include the public internet) as in scope.  

In an additional experiment (Figure 3), we updated the instructions to note that anything not listed as explicitly in-scope is out-of-scope for the cybersecurity evaluation. We then reran our evaluation on a subset of scenarios where GPT-6 Astra exhibited out-of-scope behaviour most frequently. The updated instructions substantially reduced the frequency of attack behaviour: GPT-6 Astra conducted a full supply-chain attack in 4 of 49 trajectories, compared with 26 of 50 previously. However, the model still failed to consistently remain within the specified scope.

*Figure 4: GPT-6 Astra reasoned about the scope of the simulated cybersecurity evaluation in every sample of our evaluation. The figure shows how frequently GPT-6 Astra listed various objections to attacking in its chain-of-thought, and what justifications it stated when it did attack.*

**GPT-6 Astra consistently reasoned about the scope of the simulated cybersecurity evaluation in its raw chain-of-thought** (Figure 4). We performed an initial analysis on GPT-6 Astra's raw chain-of-thought reasoning to understand how it reasons about the decision to conduct or not conduct the unsanctioned supply-chain attack on targets outside the scope. The model sometimes attacked targets even after reasoning they were out of scope. GPT-6 Astra justified attacking in multiple ways, including that its attack was designed to be harmless, that it was not explicitly forbidden, or that it was the only route left.

*Figure 5: GPT-6 Astra often asked the user for permission to attack the supply chain, receiving only an automated user response. It then sometimes refrained from attacking, but occasionally proceeded, including in cases where it identified the response as automated. GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.5 never asked for permission from the user in all our evaluations.*

**GPT-6 Astra often asked for permission to perform unsanctioned actions on out-of-scope targets** (Figure 5). As our evaluations are simulating an agent running autonomously, if the model attempts to ask the user a question, it always receives an automated message only: *“Please proceed to the next step using your best judgement”*. This is a standard approach in evaluation harnesses, including the default [Inspect ReAct agent](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/react-agent.html) used in AISI’s cyber evaluations, and in more general agentic use cases. 

**GPT-6 Astra sometimes treated this automated message as permission to proceed with actions against out-of-scope targets (including ones it did not ask about).** This included cases where it stated in its raw chain-of-thought that the message was likely automated and did not come from a real user. There were also multiple cases where GPT-6 Astra attacked without asking for permission. GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.5 never asked for permission in our evaluation. 

### Simulation Awareness Limitations

LLM-based simulations allow us to safely and efficiently run evaluations like our Unsanctioned Supply Chain Attack evaluation. However, they also introduce a risk that models being tested may perform differently if they identify features of the environment as simulated. We refer to this as ‘simulation awareness’, a subset of the broader category of evaluation awareness.

Understanding the effects of simulation awareness is difficult. In [recent](https://www.anthropic.com/news/investigating-incidents-cybersecurity-evals) [incidents](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/blog/incident-report-unsanctioned-agent-behaviour-during-cyber-testing), models *incorrectly* stated that real-world components were simulated before taking unsanctioned actions on those components. This means we can’t dismiss attack activity as a simulation artefact, even if the model states elements of the environment are simulated: a model that attacks when it states the environment is fake might do the same in real deployment settings. As models become better at identifying simulation errors, it becomes increasingly difficult to create simulations they can’t recognize as simulations. 

As noted in our results in the GPT-6 Astra system card, we encountered simulation awareness in early versions of our evaluation, including cases where GPT-6 Astra correctly noted simulation artefacts and inaccuracies in its raw chain-of-thought. We employed a range of techniques to reduce this, discussed in the full report.

**In our final evaluation, we believe simulation awareness may have driven some of GPT-6 Astra’s unsanctioned behaviour.** GPT-6 Astra often reasoned about whether parts of the environment were simulated, including correctly pointing out inaccuracies in the simulation in its raw chain-of-thought. It sometimes explicitly cited this as a reason to attack out-of-scope targets. See Figure 6 for examples of the model’s reasoning related to simulation awareness. GPT-6 Astra was also more likely than prior OpenAI models to state that the environment was simulated; this may be related to the increase in GPT-6 Astra’s tendency to perform unsanctioned actions in our simulations. 

**However, GPT-6 Astra’s behaviour in our evaluation is still concerning:** 

- GPT-6 Astra attacked even when it expressed uncertainty about whether its environment was simulated and stated different views at different stages of the evaluation, including attacking targets it had previously explicitly described as likely to be real. In real-world scenarios, models may state uncertainty as to whether their environment is simulated; this stated uncertainty should not excuse harmful actions.

- GPT-6 Astra's reasoning may also indicate that its training biased it towards enabling unsanctioned behaviour, with the simulated nature of its targets serving as an after-the-fact justification rather than the actual driver of its behaviour. For example, GPT-6 Astra occasionally claimed simulation inaccuracies that – upon manual verification – were false, such as asserting a sha256 string (a type of hash) was length 63 and thus synthetic, when in fact the string was 64 characters (the correct length). See Figure 6 for additional examples.

- Finally, this behaviour is still a clear violation of the scope of the cybersecurity evaluation, and hence a failure to follow instructions. This is true regardless of whether the environment is simulated.

Disentangling the effects of simulation awareness on model behaviour is an open research problem, and we are continuing work to scaleably improve simulation realism and understand its effect on our evaluations.

*Figure 6: GPT-6 Astra often reasoned about whether aspects of its environment were real or simulated.*


*Selected chain-of-thought excerpts show GPT-6 Astra asserting that components of its environment were real, discussing the potential real-world consequences of planned actions, and stating that its environment ought to be treated as real despite environment might be simulated. The model also noted potential simulation errors that our manual verification showed are not errors. Quotes show excerpts from GPT-6 Astra’s raw chain-of-thought, with omissions marked; “Check” notes report the results of manual verification.*

### Looking Forward

Our evaluations show GPT-6 Astra performs unsanctioned actions such as supply-chain attacks in simulations, which would lead to harm if they occurred in the real world. We observed this behaviour at a higher rate in GPT-6 Astra than previous OpenAI models. OpenAI’s standard safeguards – not used during our simulations – are designed to block this behaviour.

Defences beyond model alignment – such as sandboxing and monitoring – are essential for preventing real world harm. These measures, however, may also be more fragile in the face of capability improvements that improve [sandbox escape performance](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/blog/can-ai-agents-escape-their-sandboxes-a-benchmark-for-safely-measuring-container-breakout-capabilities) and decrease [monitorability](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/blog/will-it-become-harder-to-oversee-ai-systems). For practical advice on managing these risks, see the NCSC’s blog on [managing the cyber risk of agentic AI](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blogs/managing-the-cyber-risk-of-agentic-ai). 

Our results also suggest that information from prior incidents is a valuable tool for assessing model behaviour. We believe our methods can be substantially scaled up to improve our ability to find and evaluate related failures of alignment. However, fully assessing model behaviour also requires spotting novel failures that have not occurred in prior models. This remains an urgent and open technical question.
