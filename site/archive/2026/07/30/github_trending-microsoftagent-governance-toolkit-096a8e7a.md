Important

**Public Preview** -- production-quality public preview releases. May have breaking changes before GA.

Policy enforcement, identity, sandboxing, and SRE for autonomous AI agents. One `pip install`, any framework.

Your AI agents call tools, browse the web, query databases, and delegate to other agents. Once deployed, they make decisions autonomously. You need answers to three questions:

**1. Is this action allowed?** An agent with access to `send_email` and `query_database` should not be able to `drop_table`. OAuth scopes and IAM roles control which services an agent can reach, not what it does once connected.

**2. Which agent did this?** In a multi-agent system, five agents might share a single API key. When something goes wrong, "an agent did it" is not an incident response.

**3. Can you prove what happened?** Auditors and regulators need tamper-evident records of every decision: what policy was active, what the agent requested, and why it was allowed or denied.

Prompt-level safety ("please follow the rules") is not a control surface. It is a polite request to a stochastic system. [OWASP LLM01:2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm01-prompt-injection/) states this explicitly: *"it is unclear if there are fool-proof methods of prevention for prompt injection."* The published numbers back this up. [Andriushchenko et al. (ICLR 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151) report **100% attack success rate** on GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Claude 3, and Llama-3 using adaptive attacks with logprob access and suffix optimization, evaluated against the [JailbreakBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01318) benchmark (Chao et al., NeurIPS 2024). Microsoft's own [AI Red Teaming Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-red-teaming-agent) formalizes **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**, the rate of policy violations under adversarial input, as the canonical metric for this class of failure. [ Lessons from Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/13/3-takeaways-from-red-teaming-100-generative-ai-products/) reinforces the point: 

*"mitigations do not eliminate risk entirely"*and red teaming must be a continuous process because model-layer defenses are probabilistic by construction.

AGT does not try to win that fight inside the prompt. Every tool call, message send, and delegation is intercepted in deterministic application code *before* the model's intent reaches the wire. Actions the AGT kernel denies are not "unlikely." They are **structurally impossible**. That is the difference between asking an agent to behave and making it incapable of misbehaving.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+

`pip install agent-governance-toolkit[full]`Use the `[full]` extra for the quick-start imports below. The base
`agent-governance-toolkit` wheel installs the compliance CLI only; the governance
modules live in the consolidated core distribution. The `agentmesh` quick-start
import remains the current wrapper API. Importing `agent_os` emits a
`DeprecationWarning` because the old `agent-os-kernel` distribution is deprecated.
Use `agent-governance-toolkit-core` (or the `[full]` extra that includes it) as
the replacement distribution. Policy-engine host code uses the `agt-policies`
and ACS APIs; the pre-ACS `agent_os.policies` rule model is gone, and
`BREAKING_CHANGES.md` lists its replacements.

For Claude Code, add AGT as a plugin marketplace and install the governance plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit
/plugin install agt-governance@agent-governance-toolkit
```
Govern any tool function in two lines:

```
from agentmesh.governance import govern
safe_tool = govern(my_tool, policy="policy.yaml")   # every call checked, logged, enforced
```
That's it. `safe_tool` evaluates your YAML policy on every call, logs the decision, and raises `GovernanceDenied` if the action is blocked.

```
# policy.yaml
apiVersion: governance.toolkit/v1
name: production-policy
default_action: allow
rules:
  - name: block-destructive
    condition: "action.type in ['drop', 'delete', 'truncate']"
    action: deny
    description: "Destructive operations require human approval"
  - name: require-approval-for-send
    condition: "action.type == 'send_email'"
    action: require_approval
    approvers: ["security-team"]
```
```
>>> safe_tool(action="read", table="users")
{'table': 'users', 'rows': 42}
>>> safe_tool(action="drop", table="users")
GovernanceDenied: Action denied by policy rule 'block-destructive':
  Destructive operations require human approval
```
Or use the full `AgtRuntime` API for programmatic control:

**AgtRuntime example**

```
from agt.policies.runtime import AgtRuntime
runtime = AgtRuntime.from_manifest("manifest.yaml")
result = runtime.evaluate(
    "input",
    {
        "envelope": {"agent_id": "example-agent"},
        "input": {"body": {"action": "web_search", "params": {}}},
    },
)
print(result.verdict)
runtime.close()
```
**TypeScript / .NET / Rust / Go examples**

**TypeScript**

```
import { PolicyEngine } from "@microsoft/agent-governance-sdk";
const engine = new PolicyEngine([
  { action: "web_search", effect: "allow" },
  { action: "shell_exec", effect: "deny" },
]);
engine.evaluate("web_search"); // "allow"
engine.evaluate("shell_exec"); // "deny"
```
**.NET**

```
using AgentGovernance;
using AgentGovernance.Extensions.ModelContextProtocol;
using AgentGovernance.Policy;
var kernel = new GovernanceKernel(new GovernanceOptions
{
    PolicyPaths = new() { "policies/default.yaml" },
});
var result = kernel.EvaluateToolCall("did:mesh:agent-1", "web_search",
    new() { ["query"] = "latest AI news" });
// MCP server integration
builder.Services.AddMcpServer()
    .WithGovernance(options => options.PolicyPaths.Add("policies/mcp.yaml"));
```
**Rust**

```
use agent_governance::{AgentMeshClient, ClientOptions};
let client = AgentMeshClient::new("my-agent").unwrap();
let result = client.execute_with_governance("data.read", None);
assert!(result.allowed);
```
**Go**

```
import agentmesh "github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/agent-governance-golang"
client, _ := agentmesh.NewClient("my-agent",
    agentmesh.WithPolicyRules([]agentmesh.PolicyRule{
        {Action: "data.read", Effect: agentmesh.Allow},
        {Action: "*", Effect: agentmesh.Deny},
    }),
)
result := client.ExecuteWithGovernance("data.read", nil)
```
CLI tools:

```
agt doctor                                        # check installation
agt verify                                        # OWASP compliance check
agt verify --evidence ./agt-evidence.json --strict # fail CI on weak evidence
agt red-team scan ./prompts/ --min-grade B         # prompt injection audit
agt lint-policy policies/                          # validate policy files
```

```
Every layer is optional. Start with `govern()` and add layers as your risk profile grows. Most teams run policy enforcement + audit logging and never need the full stack.

AGT enforces governance at the application middleware layer, not at the OS kernel level. The policy engine and agents share the same process boundary.

**Production recommendation:** Run each agent in a separate container for OS-level isolation. See [Architecture: Security Boundaries](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

| Tool | Coverage | 
|---|---|
| CodeQL | Python + TypeScript SAST | 
| Gitleaks | Secret scanning on PR/push/weekly | 
| ClusterFuzzLite | 7 fuzz targets (policy, injection, MCP, sandbox, trust) | 
| Dependabot | 13 ecosystems |
