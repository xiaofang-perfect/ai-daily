HyperFrames is an open-source framework for turning HTML, CSS, media, and seekable animations into deterministic MP4 videos. Use it locally with the CLI, from AI coding agents with skills, or as the rendering core behind hosted authoring workflows.

Install the HyperFrames skills, then describe the video you want:

`npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --full-depth --yes`

`--full-depth`does a full clone of the repo's current`main`. Without it,`skills add`fetches the skills.sh registry blob, which lags`main`by hours — you'd get an older copy of a skill. (`hyperframes skills update`already installs full-depth.)

Try a prompt like:

Using

`/hyperframes`, create a 10-second product intro with a fade-in title, a background video, and subtle background music.

The skills teach agents the HyperFrames production loop: plan the video, write valid HTML, wire seekable animations, add media, lint, preview, and render. They work with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, and other coding agents that support skills.

HyperFrames ships 20 skills agents load on demand. Read `/hyperframes` first — it's the router and capability map; it picks a workflow for any "make me a…" request — video, deck, or composition port — and points to the domain skills below.

Run `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --full-depth` for the interactive picker, `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --all --full-depth` to install all 20 at once (skips the picker), or `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --skill <name> --full-depth` for just one (bare name, no leading `/`). Keep `--full-depth` — it installs the current `main`; without it `skills add` fetches the skills.sh blob, which lags by hours.

Installs stay lean after that: `npx hyperframes init` keeps the **core set** fresh (the router, the `hyperframes-*` domain skills, and `media-use` — plus whatever is already installed; `/figma` stays on demand) and never expands a partial install; the creation workflows install **on demand** — the router runs `npx hyperframes skills update <workflow>` before entering one. Nothing re-pulls the full set behind your back.

| Skill | Use when | 
|---|---|
| `/hyperframes` | Read firstfor any request to make / create / edit / animate / render a video, animation, or motion graphic. Capability map for the domain skills and intent router for the creation workflows below. | 

| Skill | Use when | 
|---|---|
| `/product-launch-video` | Marketing / launching / promoting a product— from its URL, a brief, or a script (even if the site is only named). Up to ~3 min (sweet spot 30-90s). | 
| `/website-to-video` | Turning a general websiteinto a video — site tour, portfolio / landing-page showcase, social clip from the site's own visuals. | 
| `/faceless-explainer` | Explaining a topic / conceptfrom arbitrary text — no product, no URL, no website capture; every visual is LLM-invented (typography / abstract / diagram / data-viz). | 
| `/pr-to-video` | A GitHub pull request(PR URL,`owner/repo#N`ref, or "this PR") → changelog / feature-reveal / fix / refactor explainer, read via the`gh`CLI. | 
| `/embedded-captions` | Adding captions / subtitlesto an existing talking-head video (footage untouched) — verbatim rail, embedded climax behind the subject, or pure-cinematic embed. | 
| `/talking-head-recut` | Packaging an existing talking-head / interview / podcast video with designed graphic overlays— lower-thirds, data callouts, kinetic titles, pull-quotes, side panels, PiP. | 
| `/motion-graphics` | A short, unnarrated, design-led motion graphic(~under 10s) — kinetic type, stat / chart hit, logo sting, lower-third, animated tweet / headline. MP4 or transparent overlay. | 
| `/music-to-video` | A music track(audio file, or video to pull audio from) → abeat-syncedvideo — lyric, slideshow, or kinetic promo; music drives pacing. | 
| `/slideshow` | A presentation / pitch deck / interactive deck— discrete slides, fragment reveals, branching, hotspot navigation, presenter mode. Output is a navigable deck, not a rendered video. | 
| `/general-video` | Anything else— longer or multi-scene pieces, brand / sizzle reel, title card, static loop, freeform composition. Input- and length-agnostic fallback. | 
| `/remotion-to-hyperframes` | Porting an existing Remotion(React) composition's source to HyperFrames HTML. One-way migration, not creation. | 

Atomic capabilities the creation workflows compose against — pull one when you need that specific layer.

| Skill | Covers | 
|---|---|
| `/hyperframes-core` | The composition contract — `data-*`timing attributes,`class="clip"`, tracks, sub-compositions, variables, framework-owned media playback, determinism rules. | 
| `/hyperframes-animation` | All animation knowledge — atomic motion rules, scene blueprints, transitions, runtime adapters (GSAP / Lottie / Three.js / Anime.js / CSS / WAAPI / TypeGPU). | 
| `/hyperframes-keyframes` | Seek-safe keyframe authoring across runtimes — GSAP timelines, CSS keyframes, Anime.js, WAAPI, FLIP, paths, masks, SVG morph/draw, 3D depth — plus `hyperframes keyframes`diagnostics for rendered motion. | 
| `/hyperframes-creative` | Non-animation creative direction — `frame.md`/`design.md`, palettes, typography, narration, beat planning, audio-reactive visuals, composition patterns. | 
| `/media-use` | The media OS — resolve any media need (BGM, SFX, image, icon, logo, voice, color grade, LUT) into a frozen local file or paste-ready block + ledger record, generate via TTS/music/image models when the catalog misses, transcribe, caption, remove backgrounds, and reuse assets across projects. One shared audio engine + manifest tracking. | 
| `/hyperframes-cli` | CLI dev loop — `init`,`lint`,`check`,`snapshot`,`preview`,`render`,`publish`,`doctor`, plus AWS Lambda cloud rendering (`lambda deploy / render / progress`). | 
| `/hyperframes-registry` | Install and wire registry blocks and components into compositions via `hyperframes add`. Authoring a new block or component to contribute upstream. | 
| `/figma` | Import Figma assets, tokens, components, and storyboard sections → reconstructed motion (frames read as states, not slides) (REST/CLI) plus Motion animations (MCP) and shaders (MCP source / native export) into a composition. |

**frame.md — your design system, ready for video.**

Every brand has a `design.md`. None of them were written for a camera. `frame.md` is the missing translation layer: it takes your web-context design spec and inverts it for the frame — the same tokens, the same rules, but rewritten so an AI agent can compose a promo video without guessing at scale or reaching for web chrome.

The output is a `DESIGN.md` superset your whole toolchain can read. Atoms stay sacred. Composition stays free. Numbers come from the script.

Define a video as HTML. Add data attributes for timing and tracks. Use GSAP, CSS, Lottie, Three.js, Anime.js, WAAPI, or your own frame adapter for seekable animation.

  <video
    class="clip"
    data-start="0"

Preview instantly in the browser. Render locally or in Docker. The renderer seeks each frame in headless Chrome and encodes the result with FFmpeg, so the same input produces the same video.

- **HTML-native:**compositions are HTML files with data attributes. No React requirement, no proprietary timeline format.
- **Agent-friendly:**agents already write HTML, and the CLI is non-interactive by default.
- **Deterministic:**same input, same frames, same output. Built for CI, regression tests, and automated rendering.
- **No build step:**an- `index.html`composition plays as-is and can be previewed directly in the browser.
- **Adapter-based animation:**bring GSAP, CSS animations, Lottie, Three.js, Anime.js, WAAPI, or a custom runtime.
- **Open source:**Apache 2.0 license, with no per-render fees or commercial-use thresholds.

HyperFrames is inspired by [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev). Both tools render video with headless Chrome and FFmpeg. The main difference is the authoring model: Remotion's bet is React components; HyperFrames' bet is plain HTML that humans and agents can both write easily.

| HyperFrames | Remotion | |
|---|---|---|
| Authoring | HTML + CSS + seekable animation | React components | 
| Build step | None; `index.html`plays as-is | Bundler required | 
| Agent handoff | Plain HTML files | JSX / React project | 
| Library-clock animations | Seekable, frame-accurate via adapters | Wall-clock animation patterns need care | 
| Distributed rendering | Local and AWS Lambda render paths | Remotion Lambda, mature cloud renderer | 
| License | Apache 2.0 | Source-available Remotion License |

The repo uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) for golden regression-test baselines under `packages/producer/tests/**/output.mp4` (about 240 MB of `.mp4` files). If you're cloning the full repo for development, install Git LFS first:

```
# macOS
brew install git-lfs
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install git-lfs
# Windows
winget install GitHub.GitLFS
# Then, once per machine
git lfs install
```
If you only need source files, you can skip LFS content:

`GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git`
