**Let Claude — or any LLM — actually watch a video.**

Most AI tools don't really *see* a video. Paste a YouTube link into ChatGPT and it
reads the **transcript**, not the picture. Claude won't take a video file at all.
Even Gemini, which *can* read video natively, has to send it up to Google and
samples frames at a **fixed interval** (1 fps by default), so fast cuts slip past.

`claude-real-video` does it differently, and **locally**: point it at a URL or a
file, and it pulls the frames that *actually matter* (every scene change, not a
fixed quota), throws away the near-duplicates, transcribes the audio, and hands
you a clean folder any LLM can read — on your own machine, nothing uploaded.

```
crv "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
# → crv-out/frames/*.jpg  +  crv-out/transcript.txt  +  crv-out/MANIFEST.txt
```
Then drop the frames + `MANIFEST.txt` into Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini and ask away.

Most "let an LLM watch a video" scripts (and Gemini's own pipeline) grab frames
at a **fixed interval** — e.g. one per second. That over-samples a static
screencast and under-samples a fast-cut reel. `claude-real-video` is smarter:

| fixed-interval sampling | claude-real-video | |
|---|---|---|
| Frame selection | every N seconds | scene-change detection+ density floor | 
| Repeated shots (A-B-A cuts) | sent again every time | sliding-window dedupsends each shot once | 
| Static slide (10 min) | ~600 near-identical frames | collapses to 1(dedup) | 
| Fast-cut reel | misses frames between samples | catches each visual change | 
| Audio | often ignored | Whisper transcript w/ language detect | 
| Where the video goes | often uploaded to a cloud | stays on your machine | 
| Input | usually local file only | URL (yt-dlp) or local file | 

You feed the model *fewer, more meaningful* frames — cheaper context, better
understanding.

```
pip install claude-real-video              # core (frames + dedup)
pip install "claude-real-video[whisper]"   # + audio transcription
```
`ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` are used for frame extraction and audio, and aren't
pip-installable. Install them once:

| OS | command | 
|---|---|
| macOS | `brew install ffmpeg` | 
| Linux | `sudo apt install ffmpeg`(or your distro's package manager) | 
| Windows | `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`— or`choco install ffmpeg`— or[download a build](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)and add its`bin\`folder to your`PATH` | 

Verify it's on your `PATH`:

`ffmpeg -version`Transcription uses the `whisper` CLI (installed by the `[whisper]` extra, or
`pip install openai-whisper`). Whisper also relies on ffmpeg.

Works on **macOS, Windows, and Linux** — Python 3.10+.

```
# A YouTube / Instagram / TikTok / ... link
crv "https://www.instagram.com/reel/XXXX/"
# A local file, English transcript, output to ./out
crv lecture.mp4 -o out --lang en
# Frames only, no transcription
crv clip.mp4 --no-transcribe
# A login-gated video (your own / authorised use): pass a Netscape cookie file
crv "https://..." --cookies cookies.txt
```
`python -m claude_real_video ...` works as an alias for `crv` too.

| flag | default | meaning | 
|---|---|---|
| `-o, --out` | `crv-out` | output directory | 
| `--scene` | `0.30` | scene-change sensitivity (lower = more frames) | 
| `--fps-floor` | `1.0` | at least one frame every N seconds | 
| `--max-frames` | `150` | hard cap on total frames | 
| `--lang` | `auto` | Whisper language ( `en`,`zh`,`auto`, ...) | 
| `--dedup-threshold` | `8` | % of pixels that must change for a frame to count as new; higher = fewer frames | 
| `--dedup-window` | `4` | compare against the last N kept frames — a shot the model already saw doesn't come back after a cutaway ( `1`= consecutive-only) | 
| `--report` | off | keep dropped frames in `./dropped`+ write`report.html`visualising every keep/drop decision | 
| `--no-transcribe` | off | skip audio | 
| `--keep-audio` | off | also save the full soundtrack(`audio.m4a`) so audio models canhearit | 
| `--cookies` | – | Netscape cookie file for login-gated sources | 

```
from claude_real_video import process
r = process("https://youtu.be/...", "out", lang="en")
print(r.frame_count, r.transcript_path)
```
- **Fetch**—- `yt-dlp`for URLs (optional cookies), or copy a local file.
- **Extract**— one chronological- `ffmpeg select`pass grabs every scene change- *plus*a density floor (at least one frame every- `--fps-floor`seconds), so fast cuts and slow screencasts are both covered.
- **Dedup**— real pixel difference (downscaled RGB, not a perceptual hash — hashes go blind on flat colours and equal-luma hue changes) against a- **sliding window**of the last- `--dedup-window`kept frames, so an A-B-A cutaway doesn't re-send a shot the model has already seen.- `--report`writes- `report.html`showing every keep/drop decision with its diff %, for tuning.
- **Text**— if the video- **already has subtitles**(a sidecar- `.srt`/- `.vtt`next to a local file, or an embedded subtitle track), those are used as the transcript — faster and more accurate than re-transcribing. Only when there are no subtitles does it fall back to- **Whisper**on the audio (skipped cleanly if there's no audio).
- **Audio**- *(optional,*— save the- `--keep-audio`)- **full original soundtrack**(- `audio.m4a`: music + speech + effects, copied losslessly when possible). The transcript only has the- *words*; the audio file lets a model that can listen (Gemini, GPT-4o, …) actually- *hear*the music and tone.
- **Manifest**—- `MANIFEST.txt`summarises everything for the model.

So the model can **see** (key frames), **read** (transcript) and — with `--keep-audio` —
**hear** (full soundtrack) the video. The transcript is plain text any model can read;
the tool **doesn't burn subtitles into the video** — burning is a presentation choice,
not something needed to make a video AI-readable.

- Only download content you have the right to. The `--cookies`option is for your own, authorised access — don't ship credentials in a repo.
- Re-running overwrites the output directory.
