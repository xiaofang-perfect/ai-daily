**WavFlow** introduces a paradigm for generating synchronized, high-fidelity audio from video and text inputs directly in the **raw waveform space**, bypassing latent compression entirely. Through *waveform patchifying* and *amplitude lifting*, WavFlow enables stable flow matching on raw audio via direct *x*-prediction. Evaluation on the VGGSound (VT2A) and AudioCaps (T2A) benchmarks shows that WavFlow delivers performance on par with established latent-based methods, proving that end-to-end waveform generation can match traditional frameworks in acoustic richness, fidelity, and synchronization.

```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/WavFlow.git
cd WavFlow
bash scripts/setup.sh # creates conda env 'wavflow' and installs everything
conda activate wavflow
```

## Manual setup

```
conda create -n wavflow python=3.10 -y
conda activate wavflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps
conda install -n wavflow -c conda-forge "ffmpeg<7" -y # for torio video decoding
```

All required external weights (CLIP, Synchformer, the empty-string CFG embedding) are downloaded or computed automatically on first run and cached under

`~/.cache/wavflow/`

.


⚠️ Due to organizational policy constraints, we are currently unable to release the production-trained checkpoints. We are working on a foundation checkpoint trained on fully open-source data; in the meantime you can train your own — see the[training guide].

Once you have a trained checkpoint, run:

`bash scripts/launch/predict.sh [--gpu N] [--config PATH]`

The default config is `wavflow/configs/infer.yaml`

. The input CSV (`data.csv_path`

) accepts video, text, or both:

```
video_path,caption,video_exist,text_exist
/abs/path/sample1.mp4,a whistling rocket explodes,1,1 # video + text
/abs/path/sample2.mp4,birds chirping in a forest,1,1 # video + text
,a whistling rocket explodes,0,1 # text-only
/abs/path/sample3.mp4,,1,0 # video-only
```

## Configuration reference

| Flag / env | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
`--gpu N` (or `GPU=N` ) |
`0` |
CUDA device index |
`--config PATH` (or `CONFIG_PATH=...` ) |
`wavflow/configs/infer.yaml` |
YAML config to load |
`WAVFLOW_ENV` |
`wavflow` |
conda env name to auto-activate |

Any extra positional argument is forwarded to `python -m wavflow.infer`

.

| Field | What to set |
|---|---|
`data.csv_path` |
the input CSV (above) |
`model.name` |
one of `medium_16k` , `medium_44k` , `large_16k` , `large_44k` (must match the trained ckpt) |
`model.ckpt_path` |
a `checkpoint_*.pth` (full ckpt) or `ema_epoch_*.pth` (EMA-only) |
`model.use_ema` |
`true` to load `model_ema1` from a full ckpt; `false` to use the live `model` weights |
`inference.duration_sec` / `target_sample_rate` |
output length and SR (must match model arch) |
`inference.cfg` , `num_steps` , `noise_scale` , `noise_shift` , `prediction_type` , `seed` |
sampling hyperparameters |
`inference.batch_size` |
rows per ODE batch |
`inference.trim_to_duration` |
trim output to `duration_sec` |
`output.output_dir` |
where wavs are written |
`output.loudness_norm` , `loudness_target_lufs` |
optional `pyloudnorm` post-processing |

`video_exist=0`

→ uses learned empty CLIP/Sync tokens (no video decode)`text_exist=0`

→ uses learned empty CLIP-text token (caption ignored)- Optional
`id`

column; otherwise the wav file name is derived from`Path(video_path).stem`

, falling back to`row_<idx>`

for text-only rows - Captions with commas must be quoted

The EMA tensor stored as `model_ema1`

is updated with `ema_decay = 0.9999`

per step. After only a few hundred / thousand steps it still contains random-init values and produces noise during inference. Set `model.use_ema: false`

(or pass an `ema_epoch_*.pth`

saved after enough steps) when sampling from a short / overfit run.

For feature extraction and training (single-node and multi-node), see ** TRAINING.md**.
