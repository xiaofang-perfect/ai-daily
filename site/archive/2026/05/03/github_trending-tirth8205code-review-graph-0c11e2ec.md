AI coding tools re-read your entire codebase on every task. `code-review-graph`

fixes that. It builds a structural map of your code with [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), tracks changes incrementally, and gives your AI assistant precise context via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) so it reads only what matters.

```
pip install code-review-graph # or: pipx install code-review-graph
code-review-graph install # auto-detects and configures all supported platforms
code-review-graph build # parse your codebase
```

One command sets up everything. `install`

detects which AI coding tools you have, writes the correct MCP configuration for each one, and injects graph-aware instructions into your platform rules. It auto-detects whether you installed via `uvx`

or `pip`

/`pipx`

and generates the right config. Restart your editor/tool after installing.

To target a specific platform:

```
code-review-graph install --platform codex # configure only Codex
code-review-graph install --platform cursor # configure only Cursor
code-review-graph install --platform claude-code # configure only Claude Code
code-review-graph install --platform kiro # configure only Kiro
```

Requires Python 3.10+. For the best experience, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (the MCP config will use `uvx`

if available, otherwise falls back to the `code-review-graph`

command directly).

Then open your project and ask your AI assistant:

```
Build the code review graph for this project
```


The initial build takes ~10 seconds for a 500-file project. After that, the graph updates automatically on every file edit and git commit.

Your repository is parsed into an AST with Tree-sitter, stored as a graph of nodes (functions, classes, imports) and edges (calls, inheritance, test coverage), then queried at review time to compute the minimal set of files your AI assistant needs to read.

When a file changes, the graph traces every caller, dependent, and test that could be affected. This is the "blast radius" of the change. Your AI reads only these files instead of scanning the whole project.

On every git commit or file save, a hook fires. The graph diffs changed files, finds their dependents via SHA-256 hash checks, and re-parses only what changed. A 2,900-file project re-indexes in under 2 seconds.

Large monorepos are where token waste is most painful. The graph cuts through the noise — 27,700+ files excluded from review context, only ~15 files actually read.

Full Tree-sitter grammar support for functions, classes, imports, call sites, inheritance, and test detection in every language. Includes Zig, PowerShell, Julia, and Svelte SFC support. Plus Jupyter/Databricks notebook parsing (`.ipynb`

) with multi-language cell support (Python, R, SQL), and Perl XS files (`.xs`

).

All numbers come from the automated evaluation runner against 6 real open-source repositories (13 commits total). Reproduce with `code-review-graph eval --all`

. Raw data in [ evaluate/reports/summary.md](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph/blob/main/evaluate/reports/summary.md).

**Token efficiency: 8.2x average reduction (naive vs graph)**

The graph replaces reading entire source files with a compact structural context covering blast radius, dependency chains, and test coverage gaps.

| Repo | Commits | Avg Naive Tokens | Avg Graph Tokens | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| express | 2 | 693 | 983 | 0.7x |
| fastapi | 2 | 4,944 | 614 | 8.1x |
| flask | 2 | 44,751 | 4,252 | 9.1x |
| gin | 3 | 21,972 | 1,153 | 16.4x |
| httpx | 2 | 12,044 | 1,728 | 6.9x |
| nextjs | 2 | 9,882 | 1,249 | 8.0x |
Average |
13 |
8.2x |

**Why express shows <1x:** For single-file changes in small packages, the graph context (metadata, edges, review guidance) can exceed the raw file size. The graph approach pays off on multi-file changes where it prunes irrelevant code.

**Impact accuracy: 100% recall, 0.54 average F1**

The blast-radius analysis never misses an actually impacted file (perfect recall). It over-predicts in some cases, which is a conservative trade-off — better to flag too many files than miss a broken dependency.

| Repo | Commits | Avg F1 | Avg Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| express | 2 | 0.667 | 0.50 | 1.0 |
| fastapi | 2 | 0.584 | 0.42 | 1.0 |
| flask | 2 | 0.475 | 0.34 | 1.0 |
| gin | 3 | 0.429 | 0.29 | 1.0 |
| httpx | 2 | 0.762 | 0.63 | 1.0 |
| nextjs | 2 | 0.331 | 0.20 | 1.0 |
Average |

0.38 |

**Build performance**

| Repo | Files | Nodes | Edges | Flow Detection | Search Latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| express | 141 | 1,910 | 17,553 | 106ms | 0.7ms |
| fastapi | 1,122 | 6,285 | 27,117 | 128ms | 1.5ms |
| flask | 83 | 1,446 | 7,974 | 95ms | 0.7ms |
| gin | 99 | 1,286 | 16,762 | 111ms | 0.5ms |
| httpx | 60 | 1,253 | 7,896 | 96ms | 0.4ms |

**Limitations and known weaknesses**

**Small single-file changes:**Graph context can exceed naive file reads for trivial edits (see express results above). The overhead is the structural metadata that enables multi-file analysis.**Search quality (MRR 0.35):**Keyword search finds the right result in the top-4 for most queries, but ranking needs improvement. Express queries return 0 hits due to module-pattern naming.**Flow detection (33% recall):**Only reliably detects entry points in Python repos (fastapi, httpx) where framework patterns are recognized. JavaScript and Go flow detection needs work.**Precision vs recall trade-off:**Impact analysis is deliberately conservative. It flags files that*might*be affected, which means some false positives in large dependency graphs.

**Multi-repo daemon**

If your editor doesn't support hooks (e.g. Cursor, OpenCode), or you just want your
graph to stay fresh in the background without any editor integration, the daemon is
for you. It watches your repos for file changes and automatically rebuilds the graph
— no manual `build`

or `update`

commands needed.

The daemon is included with `code-review-graph`

— no separate install required.

**Quick setup:**

```
# 1. Register the repos you want to watch
crg-daemon add ~/project-a --alias proj-a
crg-daemon add ~/project-b
# 2. Start the daemon (runs in the background)
crg-daemon start
# 3. That's it — graphs stay up to date automatically
crg-daemon status # check daemon and per-repo watcher status
crg-daemon logs --repo proj-a -f # tail logs for a specific repo
crg-daemon stop # stop daemon and all watcher processes
```

Also available as `code-review-graph daemon start|stop|status|...`

.

Under the hood, `crg-daemon add`

writes to a TOML config file at
`~/.code-review-graph/watch.toml`

. You can also edit this file directly:

```
[[repos]]
path = "/home/user/project-a"
alias = "proj-a"
[[repos]]
path = "/home/user/project-b"
alias = "project-b"
```

The daemon monitors this config file for changes and automatically starts/stops watcher processes as repos are added or removed. Health checks every 30 seconds restart dead watchers. No external dependencies required.

See [docs/COMMANDS.md](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph/blob/main/docs/COMMANDS.md#standalone-daemon-cli-crg-daemon) for the
full config reference and all available options.

**MCP Prompts** (5 workflow templates):
`review_changes`

, `architecture_map`

, `debug_issue`

, `onboard_developer`

, `pre_merge_check`


**Configuration**

To exclude paths from indexing, create a `.code-review-graphignore`

file in your repository root:

```
generated/**
*.generated.ts
vendor/**
node_modules/**
```


Note: in git repos, only tracked files are indexed (`git ls-files`

), so gitignored files are skipped automatically. Use `.code-review-graphignore`

to exclude tracked files or when git isn't available.

Optional dependency groups:

```
pip install code-review-graph[embeddings] # Local vector embeddings (sentence-transformers)
pip install code-review-graph[google-embeddings] # Google Gemini embeddings
pip install code-review-graph[communities] # Community detection (igraph)
pip install code-review-graph[eval] # Evaluation benchmarks (matplotlib)
pip install code-review-graph[wiki] # Wiki generation with LLM summaries (ollama)
pip install code-review-graph[all] # All optional dependencies
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
`CRG_GIT_TIMEOUT` |
Timeout in seconds for Git operations | `30` |
`CRG_EMBEDDING_MODEL` |
Default model for vector embeddings | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` |
`CRG_MAX_IMPACT_NODES` |
Maximum nodes to include in impact analysis | `500` |
`CRG_MAX_IMPACT_DEPTH` |
Search depth for blast-radius analysis | `2` |
`CRG_MAX_BFS_DEPTH` |
Maximum depth for graph traversal | `15` |
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
API key for Google Gemini embeddings | - |
`MINIMAX_API_KEY` |
API key for MiniMax embeddings | - |
`CRG_OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint | - |
`CRG_OPENAI_API_KEY` |
API key for OpenAI-compatible embeddings | - |
`CRG_OPENAI_MODEL` |
Model name for OpenAI-compatible embeddings | - |
`CRG_OPENAI_DIMENSION` |
Pin embedding dimension (v3 models support reduction) | - |
`NO_COLOR` |
If set, disables ANSI colors in terminal | - |
`CRG_SERIAL_PARSE` |
If `1` , disables parallel parsing (use for debugging) |
- |

OpenAI-compatible embeddings (real OpenAI, Azure, or any self-hosted gateway like
new-api / LiteLLM / vLLM / LocalAI / Ollama in openai mode) need no extra install —
just set the environment variables and pass `provider="openai"`

to `embed_graph`

:

```
export CRG_OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1 # or https://api.openai.com/v1
export CRG_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export CRG_OPENAI_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small # whatever your gateway serves
# optional:
export CRG_OPENAI_DIMENSION=1536 # pin dim (v3 models support reduction)
export CRG_OPENAI_BATCH_SIZE=100 # lower for gateways with tight limits
# (e.g. Qwen text-embedding-v4 caps at 10)
```

The cloud-egress warning is auto-skipped when the base URL points to localhost
(`127.0.0.1`

, `localhost`

, `0.0.0.0`

, `::1`

).


Model selection tip.Avoid`-preview`

/`-beta`

/`-exp`

model IDs (e.g.`google/gemini-embedding-2-preview`

) for anything you plan to keep long-term — preview models can change weights (different dimension → full re-embed required) or be deprecated without notice. Prefer stable GA releases such as`text-embedding-3-small`

/`text-embedding-3-large`

(OpenAI),`Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`

(via self-hosted vLLM / LocalAI), or`gemini-embedding-001`

(via the native Gemini provider, which requires`GOOGLE_API_KEY`

instead of the OpenAI-compatible path).Also note:

`code-review-graph`

currently embedsfunction signatures only(~10 tokens per node, e.g.`"parse_file function (path: str) returns Tree"`

). Models whose headline quality comes from long-context body understanding (such as Gemini 2 or Qwen3-8B at their MTEB-code SOTA scores) will see a much narrower quality gap against smaller models at this input length. Body/docstring embedding is tracked as a follow-up enhancement.

CRG exposes 28 MCP tools by default. In token-constrained environments, you can
limit the server to a subset of tools using `--tools`

or the `CRG_TOOLS`

environment variable:

```
# Via CLI flag
code-review-graph serve --tools query_graph_tool,semantic_search_nodes_tool,detect_changes_tool
# Via environment variable
CRG_TOOLS=query_graph_tool,semantic_search_nodes_tool code-review-graph serve
```

The CLI flag takes precedence over the environment variable. When neither is set, all tools are available. This is especially useful for MCP client configurations:

```
{
"mcpServers": {
"code-review-graph": {
"command": "code-review-graph",
"args": ["serve", "--tools", "query_graph_tool,semantic_search_nodes_tool,detect_changes_tool,get_review_context_tool"]
}
}
}
```

If you are using Windows and encounter `Invalid JSON: EOF while parsing`

or `MCP error -32000: Connection closed`

when connecting via Claude Code, do not use the `cmd /c`

wrapper in your config.

Ensure `fastmcp`

is updated to at least `3.2.4+`

. Then, configure your `~/.claude.json`

to execute the `.exe`

directly and pass the UTF-8 environment variable via the config:

```
"code-review-graph": {
"command": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\venv\\Scripts\\code-review-graph.exe",
"args": ["serve", "--repo", "C:\\path\\to\\your\\project"],
"env": { "PYTHONUTF8": "1" }
}
```

```
git clone https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph.git
cd code-review-graph
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

**Adding a new language**

Edit `code_review_graph/parser.py`

and add your extension to `EXTENSION_TO_LANGUAGE`

along with node type mappings in `_CLASS_TYPES`

, `_FUNCTION_TYPES`

, `_IMPORT_TYPES`

, and `_CALL_TYPES`

. Include a test fixture and open a PR.
