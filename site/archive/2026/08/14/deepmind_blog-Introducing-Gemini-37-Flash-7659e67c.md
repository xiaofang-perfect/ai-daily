# Introducing Gemini 3.7 Flash

![Spark icon next to the text "Gemini 3.7 Flash", all on a light blue backgorund](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/gemini-3-7-flash.width-200.format-webp.webp) 

Today, we’re building on the progress of our widely used Flash series by introducing Gemini 3.7 Flash, our most intelligent workhorse model yet for coding and agents.

This release comes just three weeks after [Gemini 3.6 Flash](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-6-flash-3-5-flash-lite-3-5-flash-cyber/), and is a direct result of developer feedback and algorithmic innovations that we look forward to bringing to future models. 3.7 Flash delivers substantial improvements across software engineering, knowledge work, and web development workflows — with an introductory price of half the original 3.6 Flash cost per million tokens.

## Better intelligence for complex workflows

3.7 Flash shows strong gains over 3.6 Flash in coding tasks like debugging and issue resolution. It also achieves higher first-pass code accuracy and has improved performance in generating production-ready code as seen in [FrontierCode 1.1 Main](https://cognition.com/frontiercode) (43.6% vs 34.4%) and [DeepSWE v1.1](https://deepswe.datacurve.ai/) (65.3% vs 49.0%).

In web development, 3.7 Flash generates more functional layouts and feature-complete apps in fewer prompts. For UI generation, the model shows high design adherence and parity based on a reference input, whether it’s a screenshot, an image, or a full design system. It outperforms 3.6 Flash on Arena.ai’s [WebDev Arena](https://arena.ai/leaderboard/code/webdev) with an Elo score of 1588 vs 1538.

For knowledge-dense fields like finance, law, and biosciences, 3.7 Flash delivers improved reasoning and accuracy. It significantly outperforms 3.6 Flash on the GDP.pdf benchmark (34.0% vs 22.0%), an eval for testing a model’s ability to process complex documents. It also surpasses 3.6 Flash in [AutomationBench](https://zapier.com/blog/introducing-automationbench/), demonstrating it can more effectively complete real-world business workflows (30.4% vs 17.0%).

From a simple text prompt to a fully playable 3D game. We used Gemini 3.7 Flash combined with Nano Banana to dynamically generate characters, items, and textures in real-time.

Stunning, interactive landing pages generated in a single shot. We used Gemini 3.7 Flash to orchestrate sub-agents, using Gemini Omni to create smooth, interactive parallax components.

From a static PDF to an interactive data story. Watch how complex annual reports are transformed into engaging web experiences complete with live charts and aggregated insights.

## Better developer experience and price

Gemini 3.7 Flash delivers a noticeably improved developer experience over 3.6 Flash. It better adapts to roadblocks, clarifies intent when needed, and follows instructions with greater fidelity. It thinks more diligently, putting in more effort into multi-step planning and tool calls. A more disciplined execution means less manual oversight and fewer retries across engineering workflows.

3.7 Flash is available through the end of the year at an introductory price
  [<sup>1</sup>](https://deepmind.google#footnote-1)
of $0.75/1M input tokens and $3.75/1M output tokens. This price combined with the enhanced model performance enables developers and customers to scale production-ready agents cost effectively.

Early customer feedback is highlighting 3.7 Flash’s performance and precision, achieving results that are significantly better than 3.6 Flash at a low cost.
