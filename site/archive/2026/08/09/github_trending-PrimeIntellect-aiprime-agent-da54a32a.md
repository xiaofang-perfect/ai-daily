Prime Agent is an open-source coding and research agent for general and long-running work. It is designed around two core abstractions:

- The **[Recursive Language Model (RLM)](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/rlm)** treats context as variables (*prompt-as-a-variable* ) and tools like recursive subagents as function calls (*programmatic tool /sub-agent calling* ) inside a persistent REPL.
- The **[Continual Harness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.09998)** stores supplemental prompts, memories, skill descriptions, and reusable subagent specifications as durable state that Prime Agent can refine through small, evidence-backed updates, local to the session by default.

Prime Agent combines a persistent Python control environment with durable harness state, so useful working context and reusable operating patterns can outlive a single chat window.

- **Everything is programmatic:** persistent IPython is the built-in model tool; file operations, shell commands, tool use, subagents, and context management happen through code.
- **Subagents are built in:**`rlm(...)` spawns real child agents for parallel or background work and returns their results programmatically.
- **The harness can improve:**`/refine` reviews the current trajectory and can apply small, evidence-backed updates to supplemental harness state. It never rewrites the immutable base system prompt, and recorded snapshots support rollback.
- **Skills are executable:** skills are importable Python packages, and the built-in skill creator can turn recurring workflows into project or personal skills.
- **Sessions run in the background:** daemon-backed agents keep running when the terminal disconnects and can be reattached later.
- **Agents communicate directly:** running agents can exchange messages and orchestrate one another without routing everything through the user.
- **Long tasks keep moving:** automatic compaction, persistent goals, heartbeats, schedules, autonomous mode, and retained subagents preserve progress across turns and terminal sessions.

Install the latest stable release on macOS or Linux:

`curl -fsSL https://app.primeintellect.ai/prime-agent/install.sh | sh`
The installer downloads a versioned release, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, installs the `prime-agent` command, and can prepare the IPython runtime used by the agent.

Start Prime Agent from the repository or directory you want it to work in:

```
cd /path/to/project
prime-agent
```
On first launch, run `/login` to choose a subscription or API-key provider. Prime Agent works in the current directory and can run commands and modify files there. Use a disposable clone, clean worktree, or another checkpoint you can inspect and restore.

Warning

Prime Agent executes model-generated Python and project commands with your user permissions. Its worker and kernel processes improve lifecycle isolation and recovery; they are **not** a security sandbox. Review changes and use trusted repositories, instructions, skills, and extensions only. Run untrusted code or instructions in an external sandbox or restricted environment.

Useful commands:

```
prime-agent agents                   # Browse running, idle, and saved sessions
prime-agent attach <agent>           # Reattach to a running session
prime-agent --resume <path|id>       # Resume a saved session
prime-agent status                   # Inspect background service state
prime-agent doctor [--fix]           # Inspect or repair background services
prime-agent update [--force]         # Update Prime Agent
prime-agent shutdown [--force]       # Stop every agent, worker, and background service
```
Prime Agent is built for long-running work, especially for evaluations in research. These features are available in the TUI, and when run autonomously.

- **Continual Harness:**`/refine` can persist focused, reviewable lessons as supplemental prompts, memories, reusable skill descriptions, or subagent specifications, with recorded refinement history. It does not replace packaging and reviewing new executable skills.
- **Direct agent-to-agent communication:** running agents and retained subagents can discover one another, exchange messages, and steer active work.
- **Daemon-backed continuity:** active sessions, IPython state, schedules, and subagents keep running when the terminal detaches and can be reattached later.
- **Heartbeats and schedules:**`/heartbeat` ,`rlm_heartbeat` , and`prime-agent schedule` can re-enter a session periodically or at a specific time.
- **Persistent goals:**`/goal` keeps an objective and its progress active across turns until it is completed, paused, or cleared.
- **Bounded autonomous mode:**`/autonomous` continues within configured turn, token, and time budgets and can run user-defined quality gates. A passed gate checks only what that gate verifies; reaching a limit does not imply task success.

Our agent and TUI is built on top of [`pi`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). We thank the authors of `pi` for their valuable work.
