**Codex CLI** is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer.

  
![Codex CLI splash](https://github.com/openai/codex/raw/main/.github/codex-cli-splash.png)


If you want Codex in your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf),

[install in your IDE.](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide)

If you want the desktop app experience, run

`codex app` or visit [the Codex App page](https://chatgpt.com/codex?app-landing-page=true).

If you are looking for the

*cloud-based agent*from OpenAI,

**Codex Web**, go to

[chatgpt.com/codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex).

Run the following on Mac or Linux to install Codex CLI:

`curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh`
Run the following on Windows to install Codex CLI:

`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"`
The standalone installers download from `https://releases.openai.com/codex` by default and fall back to GitHub Releases if a metadata or asset download is unavailable. To force GitHub Releases, set `CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM` to `false` (`0` and `no` are also accepted):

`curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM=false sh``$env:CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM='false'; irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex`
Codex CLI can also be installed via the following package managers:

```
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```
```
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```
Then simply run `codex` to get started.

## You can also go to the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest) and download the appropriate binary for your platform.

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Apple Silicon/arm64: 
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
- x86_64: 

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).
