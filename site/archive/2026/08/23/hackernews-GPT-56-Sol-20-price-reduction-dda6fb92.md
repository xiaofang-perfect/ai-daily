Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

| Tier | RPM | TPM | Batch queue limit | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Free | Not supported |  |  | 
| Tier 1 | 500 | 500,000 | 1,500,000 | 
| Tier 2 | 5,000 | 1,000,000 | 3,000,000 |
