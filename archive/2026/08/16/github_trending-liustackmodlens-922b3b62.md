The flagship DeepSeek and GLM chat models are text-only and cannot read images. ModLens is a plug-in vision engine that gives a text-only model sight. **ModLens reads images pasted straight into the chat**, no saving to a file and passing a path first.

Issues are welcome any time: [open one](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/issues/new/choose). And come find me on X: **[@liustack](https://x.com/liustack)**. What you built with it, which harness you are on, what should come next. New releases land there first, and a proper community space is on the way.

**🥇 The first vision plugin for DeepSeek Harness (dsh):** one command, `npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add @liustack/modlens@3.16.7`, and the text-only DeepSeek model behind dsh reads images through a native `modlens_read_image` tool. Updating is the same command again. The version is named rather than `@latest` on purpose: pnpm 11 holds back releases published in the last 24 hours and resolves the tag against what survives, so `@latest` would install whatever shipped a day ago ([details](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/docs/harness-setup.md#keeping-it-up-to-date)).

Pasting an image works two ways. **① Just paste.** On a text-only model the pasted image lands as a private temp file and its path enters the composer — the same interaction OpenCode and Pi ship — and the `modlens_read_image` tool takes it from there. **② Pick a `(modlens vision)` entry** in the model selector (it remembers your choice, so once is enough), then paste: the thumbnail stays visible in your message, closer to the Codex app feel, and the image is converted to structured evidence at request time, answered by the same underlying route. The plugin auto-discovers every provider route carrying text-only DeepSeek or GLM models and adds a wrapped entry per route (a stock install gets **`DeepSeek-V4-Flash (modlens vision)`** and **`DeepSeek-V4-Pro (modlens vision)`**; extra routes like opencode-go or zai get their own); the two families' own vision models are excluded automatically. Which paste route applies is the host's per-model call: only a model its metadata positively confirms text-only is taken over, anything unconfirmed is left alone, so vision models keep their native paste ([details](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/docs/harness-setup.md)).

**Paste an image and it reads it.** No saving to a file and passing a path first.

- **The lightest touch on the market.** No hooks, no wrappers, no local proxy daemon, not a single line changed in any harness config: on the skill harnesses it is exactly one skill folder, on dsh exactly one plugin. Uninstalling is deleting a folder, and your agents are back to stock.
- **Zero-config start.** Reuses what Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or Pi already have set up: the multimodal models on your machine go straight to work. Nothing at all? Antigravity CLI is a free no-key channel, and a free Gemini key brings a read down to 5-10 seconds.
- **Evidence, not imagination.** Full transcription, reading-order layout regions, entity and relation lists. The model quotes specifics.
- **Install once, use everywhere.** Verified on real machines in Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and OpenCode.

**Step 1, hand it to your AI.** Send it this line:

Install and configure the modlens skill following [https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/INSTALL.md), then run the health check and tell me the result.


The install starts by checking what your machine already has. An existing login in Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or Pi can be enough: modlens asks before reusing any of them, and the health check tells you where things stand.

**Step 2, only if the health check comes back empty, set up a free engine.** The recommended choice is a free Gemini API key (about three minutes at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com), no credit card), which also makes every read 5-10 seconds. A free OpenAI-compatible key from another platform works too. To avoid any sign-up, install Antigravity CLI instead, then sign in:

```
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
agy                                                           # sign in, then exit
```
The install also inventories vision reachable through your other local harness CLIs (Codex, OpenCode, Pi) and asks, per harness, whether modlens may reuse it. Granted logins join the engine pool as equals, and every reused read is labeled with whose quota it spent.

Once installed, just chat. Paste an image or drop a path, ask anything, and the skill triggers on its own: the image goes to a vision engine and the answer comes back grounded in what it read.

ModLens does not depend on any single vision service. Nine sources of vision in total: five built-in providers, any one of which is enough, plus four local agent CLIs whose logins can be reused. The built-ins:

| Provider | What it needs | Speed per read | Good for | 
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-api` | a free Gemini API key ( [3 minutes, no card](https://aistudio.google.com) ) | 5-10s | the recommended default | 
| `openai` | any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (key + baseUrl + model) | 5-10s | qwen-vl, GLM, self-hosted gateways | 
| `anthropic` | an Anthropic API key | 5-10s | machines already holding one | 
| `antigravity-cli` | the free `agy` CLI, one browser sign-in, no key | 15-45s | zero-signup starts | 
| `claude-cli` | a signed-in Claude Code | 20-45s | riding your existing Claude subscription | 

Without a pinned provider, every configured engine forms one failover chain: the fast API providers try first, the agent CLIs back them up, the first good result wins, and `meta.attempts` records every attempt so a fallback is never silent.

Any endpoint speaking the OpenAI chat-completions protocol with image input plugs straight in — that covers most of the vision-model world:

```
modlens config set openai.baseUrl https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1   # qwen-vl
modlens config set openai.apiKey  <key>
modlens config set openai.model   qwen3-vl-plus
```
The same three keys work for GLM's open platform, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, a self-hosted vLLM/Ollama, or any gateway of your own. If your favorite vision model has an OpenAI-compatible API, ModLens can drive it.

Two more sources of vision need zero new keys, each behind one explicit consent recorded in config:

- **The harness you are talking in right now.** Running inside Claude Code with a subscription signed in?`claude-cli` reads images through it out of the box. The install flow asks the same question for whichever harness you install into.
- **Every other agent CLI on the machine.**`modlens doctor` discovers them, you grant per harness, and they join the same failover chain with no priority over your own keys. Every reused read is labeled in`meta.warnings` with whose quota it spent, so nothing is ever silently billed:

| Reused CLI | What it needs | Grant with | Rides as | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | a signed-in Codex CLI with a vision model | `config set reuse.codex true` | agent lane, 15-45s | 
| OpenCode | a vision model configured in OpenCode | `config set reuse.opencode true` | agent lane, 15-45s | 
| Pi | model credentials held by Pi | `config set reuse.pi true` | an API key upgrades to the 5-10s inline lane, OAuth drives Pi itself | 
| Grok | a signed-in Grok CLI (SuperGrok) | `config set reuse.grok true` | agent lane, 15-45s | 

Two knobs: `modlens config set provider <name>` states a preference (the chain still backs it up), `-p <name>` pins exactly one with no fallback. Machines behind a proxy set `HTTPS_PROXY` or `modlens config set proxy <url>` and the API providers route through it. Details: the [CLI manual](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/docs/cli.md) for defaults and flags, [Configuration](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/skills/modlens/references/configure.md) for every key, and [Security](https://github.com/liustack/modlens/blob/main/docs/security.md) for who fetches what on remote URLs.

Unedited runs, all driving a text-only DeepSeek-V4-Flash.

The newest one first: pasting a screenshot straight into DeepSeek Harness on the `DeepSeek-V4-Flash (modlens vision)` variant. The paste keeps its native thumbnail, the trajectory shows the image arriving "already transcribed by the modlens vision bridge", and the answer walks the UI element by element.

A tweet screenshot in the Codex desktop app. It reads the author, the caption, the photo itself (down to what both people are wearing), the timestamp, and every engagement number: 5.4M views, 1.6K replies, 5.7K reposts, 116K likes.

Three images pasted at once. The model reads them one by one, spots that they belong to one visual family, and describes each illustration's content and style.

![Three images dropped together, read one by one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liustack/modlens/main/assets/demo-codex-batch.jpg)


The stress test: a scatter plot comparing 128 AI models. It reads both axes, the log scale, the per-provider color coding, the highlighted region, and every DeepSeek model called out with dashed markers. Dense charts are where vision bridges most often fail.

And the paste path, end to end, in a Claude Code terminal on DeepSeek. The pasted image arrives as a path rather than pixels, the skill triggers on its own, the guard confirms the model truly has no vision, and the slide's full content comes back: titles, layout, background, plus an honestly stated uncertainty about the truncated filename.
