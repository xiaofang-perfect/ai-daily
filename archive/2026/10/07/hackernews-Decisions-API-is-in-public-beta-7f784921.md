The Decisions API evaluates text, images, or both and returns typed answers about 10x faster than the Responses API. Get the probability that a condition is true, a choice from a fixed set, or a score against a rubric. Use those answers to classify content, route requests, and prioritize work in your application.

Try the Decisions API in the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/decisions) to experiment with questions and inputs before writing code.

The Decisions API is in public beta, and we expect to GA in the coming weeks.
`gpt-6-luna` is the only model currently available. Use the dedicated `POST   /v1/decisions` endpoint.

To run the SDK examples below, use these OpenAI SDK versions or later: Python 3.26.0, JavaScript 7.30.0, Go 3.73.0, Ruby 0.101.0, and Java 4.78.0. See [OpenAI SDK](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/libraries) for installation instructions.

## How decisions work

A request has three parts:

| Field | Purpose | 
|---|---|
| `model` | The model that evaluates the request. Currently, only `gpt-6-luna` is supported. | 
| `input` | Shared evidence for the questions: a text string or user messages containing text and images. | 
| `questions` | What to evaluate, including each question’s type, instructions, and any allowed choices or score levels. | 

The response contains an `answers` array. Give each question a unique `name` to identify its answer; the API echoes that name in the response.

### Choose a question type

| Type | Use it to | Main result | 
|---|---|---|
| `predicate` | Check a condition, such as visible damage or passage relevance. | `probability`: an estimate from 0 to 1 that the condition is true. | 
| `choice` | Select one option, such as a department or content category. | `choice`: one of your supplied values. | 
| `score` | Rate an input against ordered levels, such as issue severity. | `score`: the probability-weighted average of the level indices. | 

Both `choice` and `score` return probabilities over discrete options. Use `choice` for categories without an order, such as departments. Use `score` for ordered levels, such as severity; it takes the probability-weighted average of their numeric indices to produce a score that can fall between levels.

Use Decisions when your application needs one of these answer types. Use [Structured Outputs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs) with the Responses API when you need to generate an object that follows your own JSON schema, such as extracted fields or a written explanation, or [function calling](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling) when you need a model to request a tool call with arguments.

## Check an image for visible damage

Use a `predicate` question to check a product photo for visible damage. This request combines the image with instructions to look for a crack, tear, or dent.

```
IMAGE_BASE64="$(base64 < product.png | tr -d '\r\n')"
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/decisions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- <<JSON
{
  "model": "gpt-6-luna",
  "input": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {"type": "input_text", "text": "Inspect the product in this photo."},
      {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:image/png;base64,$IMAGE_BASE64"}
    ]
  }],
  "questions": [{
    "type": "predicate",
    "name": "visible_damage",
    "instructions": "Does the product have visible damage, such as a crack, tear, or dent? Ignore shadows and damage to the packaging."
  }]
}
JSON
```
An illustrative response excerpt:

```
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "type": "predicate",
      "name": "visible_damage",
      "probability": 0.92
    }
  ]
}
```
The `probability` is the model’s estimate that the condition is true. Use it to flag photos for review based on a threshold you choose.

Images must be inline base64 data URLs. Hosted HTTP or HTTPS image URLs and `file_id` inputs aren’t supported by this endpoint. Combine `input_text` and `input_image` parts in a user message to evaluate images together with instructions or other context.

## Select from fixed options

A `choice` question selects one value from the options you provide. Use distinct values and descriptions that explain when each option applies.

This request routes a customer complaint:

```
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/decisions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-6-luna",
    "input": "I was charged twice for my order.",
    "questions": [{
      "type": "choice",
      "name": "department",
      "instructions": "Which department should handle this complaint?",
      "choices": [
        {"value": "billing", "description": "Payments, invoices, and refunds."},
        {"value": "technical", "description": "Problems using the product."},
        {"value": "shipping", "description": "Delivery and tracking."},
        {"value": "other", "description": "Requests outside these categories."}
      ]
    }]
  }'
```
An illustrative response excerpt:

```
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "type": "choice",
      "name": "department",
      "choice": "billing",
      "probabilities": [
        { "value": "billing", "probability": 0.95 },
        { "value": "technical", "probability": 0.02 },
        { "value": "shipping", "probability": 0.01 },
        { "value": "other", "probability": 0.02 }
      ],
      "confidence": 0.93
    }
  ]
}
```
The answer’s `choice` field contains a supplied value, here `"billing"`. It also includes a `probabilities` array for the options and a `confidence` field. See [Interpret the answers](https://developers.openai.com#interpret-the-answers) for guidance on setting thresholds.

Include a fallback option such as `"other"` when your categories don’t cover every possible input. Your application can send that result to a general review queue.

## Score against a rubric

A `score` question evaluates an input against ordered `levels`. Define the criteria for each level and arrange them from lowest to highest.

```
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/decisions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-6-luna",
    "input": "Export fails in Safari but works in Chrome.",
    "questions": [{
      "type": "score",
      "name": "severity",
      "instructions": "How severe is this issue?",
      "levels": [
        {"label": "Cosmetic", "description": "Appearance only; no lost functionality."},
        {"label": "Workaround available", "description": "A task fails, but another way works."},
        {"label": "Fully blocked", "description": "A task fails with no workaround."}
      ]
    }]
  }'
```
An illustrative response excerpt:

```
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "type": "score",
      "name": "severity",
      "score": 1.1,
      "probabilities": [
        { "value": 0, "label": "Cosmetic", "probability": 0.1 },
        { "value": 1, "label": "Workaround available", "probability": 0.7 },
        { "value": 2, "label": "Fully blocked", "probability": 0.2 }
      ],
      "confidence": 0.55
    }
  ]
}
```
Level indices start at 0. Here, 0 means cosmetic, 1 means a workaround is available, and 2 means fully blocked. The returned `score` is a probability-weighted average, so it can fall between levels. In this example, probabilities of 0.1, 0.7, and 0.2 produce a score of 1.1.

The answer also includes `confidence` and the per-level `probabilities`. The score summarizes the distribution across levels. Use `choice` to select a single category.

## Ask multiple questions

Put independent questions in the same `questions` array to evaluate shared input. For a product photo, you could check for damage and classify the product category in one request. Each question can use a different type.

For decisions that depend on an earlier answer, send separate requests. For example, check for damage first, then use the result to decide whether to request a repair category.

Write questions around observable criteria. Separate different concerns into different questions, give choices distinct meanings, and define score levels so that adjacent levels have distinct criteria.

## Interpret the answers

Predicates return the estimated probability that a condition is true. Choice and score answers return a probability distribution and a separate `confidence` field.

Use labeled examples from your application to set thresholds for routing, filtering, or review. Choose thresholds based on the cost of false positives and false negatives.

## Pricing and availability

With `gpt-6-luna`, input costs **$0.10 per 1M tokens**. You pay only for input tokens: there are no cache-read, cache-write, or output-token charges.

Regional processing premiums and long-context input pricing multipliers apply. These rates apply to `/v1/decisions`; other requests using `gpt-6-luna` follow the applicable [model and processing-tier pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing).

The Decisions API supports Zero Data Retention (ZDR) and HIPAA use for eligible customers. Data residency and regional processing are supported in the United States and Europe (EEA + Switzerland). See [data controls](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/your-data) for eligibility requirements, required agreements, and limitations.

## Add voice control

Use [client delegation with the Live API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/decisions-voice) to choose actions from voice requests and report their results to the user.
