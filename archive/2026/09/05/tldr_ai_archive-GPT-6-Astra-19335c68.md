Today, we are releasing GPT-6 Astra, the most capable model we have ever broadly deployed. Astra is our first model to reach the Critical level of cybersecurity capability under our Preparedness Framework.

The most important things to know about the safety of this launch are as follows:

1. **GPT-6 Astra is a significant step up in cyber capabilities
and meets our Critical threshold.** This means that, with the
right tools and access, GPT-6 Astra can find previously unknown security
flaws and develop new ways to exploit them across many well-protected
systems without a person guiding each step. Accordingly, we
significantly strengthened our protections against the model taking
harmful cyber actions, whether that’s due to misuse or misalignment. We
also took steps to secure our internal development and deployment of
Astra and similar models, including stricter isolation, checkpoint
encryption, universal monitoring of full trajectories including chains
of thought (CoT), and a blocking alignment evaluation process before
internal use.
2. **GPT-6 Astra is significantly more robust than its
predecessors** . Incorporating new robustness safety training
techniques, GPT-6 Astra is significantly more robust to jailbreaks than
GPT-5.6 Sol, including across longer trajectories. We know this from
offline tests and our program of rigorous internal and external
jailbreak testing and remediation. For users flagged as potentially high
risk, we have additionally trained in the ability to adjust the model’s
refusal boundary to be more conservative and cover a broader range of
dual use risks. We use regression testing to make sure Astra is robust
against jailbreaks found in previous testing periods, and performed new
rounds of automated red-teaming with our latest internal red-teaming
attackers to validate our improvements.
3. **GPT-6 Astra is better aligned than GPT-5.6 Sol.** Astra is a significant step forward in model alignment, and includes
alignment improvements spanning the composition of our pre-training data
to our grading during reinforcement learning. We report a[new suite of alignment evaluations](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-astra/alignment) , and
find that GPT-6 Astra is stronger at respecting safety and security
boundaries and staying within its authorized scope. In a simulation
using more than[54,000
internal Codex tasks](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-astra/forecasting-misaligned-behavior-with-deployment-simulation-of-internal-codex-traffic) , Astra also received roughly half as
many flags for higher-severity misaligned behavior as Sol.
4. **We are deploying misalignment monitoring broadly** . We
view model alignment as the primary lever to prevent potential
misaligned behavior from our models. However, monitoring provides broad
visibility into frontier model behavior, illuminating opportunities to
further improve alignment and safety. In addition, monitoring serves as
an additional layer of protection against misaligned behavior that is
detected. For these reasons, we have additionally added misalignment
monitoring to all tool-using inference involved in our external
deployment of Astra, with significant compute cost. This system
parallels our internal setup.
5. **GPT-6 Astra’s monitorability has decreased relative to
GPT-5.6 Sol.** We have performed significant investigations on
the[monitorability](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-astra/monitorability) and[controllability](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-astra/cot-controllability) of
GPT-6 Astra. We have found that GPT-6 Astra is more capable of
controlling its own CoT than GPT 5.6-Sol, and less likely to include
incriminating information in its CoT. In adversarial settings (where we
push the model to evade our monitors) we find that the model is able to
remain undetected when strategically underperforming in evaluations
(sandbagging) and can sometimes evade our internal monitors when asked
to perform[__certain__
__sabotage tasks__](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-astra/monitor-evasion) . We have not seen evidence of
steganographic CoT reasoning (e.g., concealing hidden reasoning within
ordinary and seemingly unrelated text), indicating that the evasion risk
may largely be bounded to lower reasoning tasks.
  - These findings indicate that the Astra class models could evade our CoT monitors under adversarial conditions. Right now, these findings are largely based on adversarial evaluations (i.e., when we instruct the model to evade monitoring), and overall our alignment evaluations show that Astra is less likely than GPT-5.6 Sol to violate security and safety restrictions overall.
  - However, we take the trend seriously, and we are continuing to investigate these findings and their implications for monitorability as our models become more capable. OpenAI has [__worked to__ __preserve
and utilize__](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11473) chain of thought monitoring, and preserving CoT
monitorability is a core goal of the research program. However, these
results also underscore the importance of developing alignment auditing
techniques beyond examining the model’s chain of thought.
6. **GPT-6 Astra more responsibly navigates browsing and workplace
settings:** GPT-6 Astra is significantly more robust to prompt
injections than GPT-5.6 Sol. We have additionally tested the model’s
behavior in realistic browsing and professional computer environments,
and find that the model is significantly less likely to perform
misaligned and potentially destructive actions (for instance
unauthorized transactions, data loss, excessive access, or circumvention
of controls) compared to GPT-5.6 Sol. It also acts more safely when
handling harmful requests in agentic settings, such as requests to
assist with violent attack planning or commit fraud.
7. **GPT-6 Astra is significantly safer in higher-risk
scenarios.** GPT-6 Astra responds more safely than GPT-5.6 Sol to
challenging requests drawn from production and adversarial human
red-teaming. Astra achieves a Pareto improvement in safely completing
unsafe requests and avoiding unnecessary refusals to harmless requests.
These improvements extend to high-severity scenarios where the risk of
harm emerges from the broader context rather than an explicit request.
Astra also applies age-appropriate safety boundaries more consistently
for users under 18.
