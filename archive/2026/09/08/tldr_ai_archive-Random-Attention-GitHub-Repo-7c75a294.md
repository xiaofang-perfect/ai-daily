Code for the paper [*Random Attention: Rethinking KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Reasoning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.03430) (arXiv:2609.03430).

📄 [Paper (arXiv:2609.03430)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.03430) · 🌐 [Project page](https://arthur-heng.github.io/Random-Attention-page/) · 🧵 [Thread](https://x.com/HengWang_uiuc/status/2095685764302475563)

**Random Attention** (`random_pp` in the code) is a signal-free KV-cache eviction policy for reasoning models:
keep the prompt, then keep a *uniformly random* per-KV-head subset of the generated tokens up to the budget
(plus a short recency window). It reads no attention scores, no value statistics, and no calibration data, so
an eviction round costs only the compaction itself. On MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, AIME, HMMT and LiveCodeBench, at
matched budgets, it matches or beats learned selectors (SnapKV, R-KV, VaSE, TriAttention) on Qwen3-4B/14B/32B
and Phi-4-reasoning, and it is the fastest evictor in both the Hugging Face harness and a vLLM serving stack.
The repository contains the eviction engine, the evaluation harness, the significance tests, the efficiency
benchmarks, the vLLM port, and the mechanism-study tooling that produced every number in the paper.

kvcompress/engine/     KV-eviction engine: every method in the paper as an eviction mode (cache_utils.py),
                       evict-attention forwards for Qwen3 / phi3 / llama, faithful TriAttention scorer, engine tests
kvcompress/harness/    evaluation harness (adapted from VaSE, see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md): eval_hf.py, the sharded
                       multi-worker launcher parallel_run_hf_mw.py, graders' utilities, TriAttention calibration + stats
kvcompress/eval/       grading (math/science, LiveCodeBench), cell-integrity audit, paired significance tests,
                       shard repair, LaTeX table generator
kvcompress/analysis/   mechanism studies: retention logs, fork replay/autopsy, carrier mass, eviction timing bench
kvcompress/synth/      the controlled synthetic-retrieval study (registered protocol, tables)
scripts/run_cell.sh    canonical launcher for one (model, task, method, budget) accuracy cell
scripts/grade_cell.sh  integrity check + grading of a cell
scripts/efficiency/    HF throughput protocols (VaSE fixed-batch, iso-memory, max-batch, eviction-round timing)
scripts/vllm_rp_bench/ Random Attention inside TriAttention's vLLM 0.19 runtime (own README + RUNBOOK)
scripts/mechanism/     retention-log panels and fork-replay launchers

git clone https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/Random-Attention && cd Random-Attention
bash setup.sh                 # Python 3.10 venv: torch 2.4.0 (cu121), flash-attn 2.7.3, transformers 5.0.0, ...

- **Models** : Hugging Face checkpoints under`$RA_MODELS_DIR/<name>` (default`models/` ):`Qwen3-4B` ,`Qwen3-14B` ,`Qwen3-32B` ,`phi-4-reasoning` , optionally`DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B` .
- **Data** :`$RA_DATA_DIR/<task>/test.jsonl` -- see`data/README.md` for the format and sources. Our
LiveCodeBench subsets are included.
- **Hardware** : the paper's experiments ran on 8x H200 (141 GB).

scripts/run_cell.sh Qwen3-4B math vase               # VaSE with the faithful n_large = K/4

Add `--dry-run` to print the exact `parallel_run_hf_mw.py` command. Cells resume when re-launched; completions
land under `results/<model>/<task>_K<K>/<method>/`. the header of `scripts/run_cell.sh` lists every method and its flags.

```
scripts/grade_cell.sh Qwen3-4B math_K1024 dense,random_pp,attn,attn_rkv_l05,vase_faithful,triattn_ph_memofix
python kvcompress/eval/stats_paired.py --base results/Qwen3-4B/math_K1024 --data_name math \
       --method_a random_pp --methods_b attn,attn_rkv_l05,vase_faithful,triattn_ph_memofix   # paired bootstrap + sign test
python kvcompress/eval/gen_paper_tables.py --results <graded.tsv> --lcb <lcb.tsv> --out tables/
```
`grade_cell.sh` runs `cell_integrity.py` first: grading is positional (problem = shard offset + line), so a
mixed, ragged or overlapping cell is refused rather than silently mis-graded. Accuracy is `flag_acc`
(answer correct); `acc_strict` additionally requires termination within the 32k cap and is reported as a
diagnostic.

- Hugging Face harness: `scripts/efficiency/*.sh` (fixed-batch VaSE protocol, iso-memory max-batch serving,
eviction-round timing). Never report tokens/s from the batched accuracy runs -- they share GPUs.
- vLLM serving: `scripts/vllm_rp_bench/` -- Random Attention as a selector inside TriAttention's vLLM 0.19
runtime (their paged-KV compression machinery, our selection rule), with the accuracy-transfer check and the
runtime shims documented in its README.

`KEEPLOG=1` retention logging, `FORCE_KEEP_RANGE` fork replays (`kvcompress/analysis/fork_replay.py`,
`fork_autopsy.py`), carrier-head mixing modes, and the registered synthetic-retrieval protocol
(`kvcompress/synth/`) are driven by engine environment switches documented in the `kvcompress/engine/cache_utils.py` header.
