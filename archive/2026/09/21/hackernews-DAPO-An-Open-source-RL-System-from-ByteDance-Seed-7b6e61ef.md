**🔥 News!!!**

- [2025/05] We update the [wandb training record](https://wandb.ai/verl-org/DAPO%20Reproduction%20on%20verl?nw=wmb4qxfht0n) of full DAPO and the[checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B) which achieved 50%+ on AIME 2024. We also provide[instructions](https://github.com#evaluation-on-aime-2024) for evaluation on AIME 2024.
- [2025/03] We release the training record of an early version of DAPO (w/o Token-level PG Loss & Dynamic Sampling), achieving 44% on AIME 2024, in [wandb](https://wandb.ai/verl-org/DAPO%20Reproduction%20on%20verl?nw=u7n2j5sht28) .

We release a fully open-sourced system for large-scale LLM RL, including algorithm, code infrastructure, and dataset. The system achieves state-of-the-art large-scale LLM RL performance. We propose the **D**ecoupled Clip and **D**ynamic s**A**mpling **P**olicy **O**ptimization (**DAPO**) algorithm.
Through open-sourcing, we provide the broader research community and society with practical access to scalable reinforcement learning, enabling all to benefit from these advancements. Our system is based on the awesome [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) framework. Thanks for their great work!

🤗 If you have any questions about our paper, issues are welcomed and we could discuss there. Thank you!

🚀 **DAPO** achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 based on the Qwen2.5-32B base model, outperforming the previous SoTA DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B with 50% training steps.

1. 
**Length stability and growth** : The steady increase in response length allows for greater exploration, facilitating the model’s ability to learn more complex reasoning behaviors, ultimately contributing to training stability and performance improvement.
2. 
**Reward score stability** : A stable increase in the reward signal indicates that the model is successfully fitting the training distribution, ensuring that the learning process remains robust and consistent without significant fluctuations.
3. 
**Entropy and mean probability trend** : A controlled increase in entropy, after an initial decrease, ensures a healthy balance between exploration and exploitation, avoiding issues such as overfitting or excessive randomness, and promoting sustained model performance.

We provide the model weights of [DAPO-Qwen-32B](https://huggingface.co/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B), which is trained based on Qwen2.5-32B using the DAPO algorithm.

We recommend using conda to setup the environment:

```
conda create -n dapo python=3.10
conda activate dapo
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
We provide the model inference code here:

```

To evaluate the model on AIME 2024, we deploy DAPO-Qwen-32B with Ray Serve and vLLM.

To load the model from Huggingface:

```
serve run eval.llm:build_app model=BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B tensor-parallel-size=8
# open another terminal
python eval/eval_aime24.py --temperature 1.0 --top_p 0.7 --max_tokens 20480 --model BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B --test_file eval/aime-2024.parquet
```
To load the model from local path:

```
serve run eval.llm:build_app model=aaa/bbb/ccc tensor-parallel-size=8
# open another terminal
python eval/eval_aime24.py --temperature 1.0 --top_p 0.7 --max_tokens 20480 --model ccc --test_file eval/aime-2024.parquet
```
To benefit the broader research community, we fully open-source the recipe of our RL training, including algorithm details, dataset, and infrastructures.

We provide training and validation datasets for DAPO training.

Training: [DAPO-Math-17k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k), a carefully curated and processed math dataset.
Validation: [AIME 2024](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/AIME-2024).

We provide the [out-of-the-box](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/gm-tyx/puffin/main/recipe/dapo) script for DAPO training reproduction. Quickstart and core code are mentioned in [README](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/gm-tyx/puffin/main/recipe/dapo/README.md). These are scripts for:

- [Datasets Preparation](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/gm-tyx/puffin/main/recipe/dapo/prepare_dapo_data.sh)
- [DAPO w/o Token-level PG Loss & Dynamic Sampling -- AIME 44](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/gm-tyx/puffin/main/recipe/dapo/run_dapo_early_qwen2.5_32b.sh)
- [DAPO Full -- AIME 50](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/gm-tyx/puffin/main/recipe/dapo/run_dapo_qwen2.5_32b.sh)

Note:

- 
The `DAPO w/o Token-level PG Loss & Dynamic Sampling -- AIME 44` script has been verified on the current verl and achieves 44 points on AIME 2024, whose training record can be accessed in[wandb](https://wandb.ai/verl-org/DAPO%20Reproduction%20on%20verl?nw=u7n2j5sht28) .
- 
The `DAPO Full -- AIME 50` script has also been validated on the latest verl version. It scores 50 points on AIME 2024. You can view the corresponding training record on[wandb](https://wandb.ai/verl-org/DAPO%20Reproduction%20on%20verl?nw=wmb4qxfht0n) .

We thank the [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) for providing the awesome open-source RL infrastructure.

Our open-sourced experiments were conducted on the Volcano Engine Machine Learning Platform. We will provide a full reproduction guideline later on the Volcano Engine platform to help users replicate our experiments.
