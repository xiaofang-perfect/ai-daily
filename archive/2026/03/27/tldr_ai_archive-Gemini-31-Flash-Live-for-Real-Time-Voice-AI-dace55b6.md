Today, we’re advancing Gemini’s real-time dialogue capabilities with Gemini 3.1 Flash Live, our highest-quality audio and voice model yet. It delivers the speed and natural rhythm needed for the next generation of voice-first AI, offering a more intuitive experience for developers, enterprises and everyday users.

3.1 Flash Live is available across Google products:

- For developers in preview via the
[Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live)in[Google AI Studio](http://ai.studio/live) - For enterprises in
[Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini-enterprise-for-customer-experience?e=48754805) - For everyone via
[Search Live](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-live-global-expansion)and[Gemini Live](https://gemini.google/overview/gemini-live/)

## For developers: Robust reasoning and task execution

We’ve improved 3.1 Flash Live’s overall quality, making it more reliable for developers and enterprises to build voice-first agents that can complete complex tasks at scale. On [ComplexFuncBench Audio](https://github.com/zai-org/ComplexFuncBench?tab=readme-ov-file), a benchmark that captures multi-step function calling with various constraints, it leads with a score of 90.8% compared to our previous model.

On Scale AI’s [Audio MultiChallenge](https://labs.scale.com/leaderboard/audiomc), Gemini 3.1 Flash Live leads with a score of 36.1% with “thinking” on. The benchmark specifically tests complex instruction following and long-horizon reasoning amidst the interruptions and hesitations typical of real-world audio.

3.1 Flash Live also has improved tonal understanding to deliver more natural dialogue. In [Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini-enterprise-for-customer-experience?e=48754805), it’s even more effective at recognizing acoustic nuances like pitch and pace than 2.5 Flash Native Audio. It’s also better at dynamically adjusting its response to users' expressions of frustration or confusion.

3.1 Flash Live lets you build voice-ready agents that handle complex tasks in noisy environments.
