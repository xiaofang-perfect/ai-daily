**Footnotes**

- **General Testing Details**- Unless stated otherwise, Kimi K2.7 Code and K2.6 were tested with thinking mode enabled via Kimi Code CLI at temperature = 1.0, top-p = 0.95, and a 262,144-token context length; GPT-5.5 ran in Codex with xhigh mode, and Opus 4.8 in Claude Code with xhigh mode. Aside from these differences, all benchmarks were evaluated under the same conditions.
 
- **Coding Benchmarks**- Kimi Code Bench V2 is our in-house benchmark designed to evaluate coding agents on realistic tasks. It has diversed software engineering tasks across 10+ mainstream programming languages and a full production tech stack covering tasks from internal engineering use cases, production incidents, and real-world open-source projects, with emphasis on backend services, infrastructure, performance engineering, systems programming, security, frontend development, and ML/data engineering.
- [Program Bench](https://programbench.com/)evaluates code-generation agents by asking them to recreate a program’s behavior from only a compiled binary and its documentation. It spans 200 tasks, from small CLI tools to large systems like FFmpeg and SQLite. Submissions are judged against over 248,000 fuzz-generated behavioral tests. In each task, the agent is given an executable and its documentation, but no source code, decompilation, or internet access. It must choose its own implementation language, build the full program from scratch, and pass a behavioral test suite comparing its output against the original binary.
- [MLS-Bench](https://mls-bench.com)evaluates whether AI systems can invent generalizable and scalable ML methods. MLS-Bench-Lite is the official 30-task subset of MLS-Bench, covering LLM pretraining and post-training, robotics, world models, computer vision, reinforcement learning, optimization, ML systems, AI for Science, and more. Agents are given 5 hours to explore before submitting their solutions. Opus 4.8 is evaluated with the max effort setting in Claude Code.
 
- **Agentic Benchmarks**- Kimi Claw 24/7 Bench is our in-house benchmark for evaluating long-horizon agentic performance in persistent, multi-day coworking tasks. It spans 17 professional scenarios across 610 evaluation points, covering domains such as software engineering, ML research, recruiting, trading, marketing. All tasks are executed through the OpenClaw harness. The final score is the average pass rate across all evaluation points, and is averaged over 3 runs.
- [MCP-Atlas](https://labs.scale.com/leaderboard/mcp_atlas)evaluates LLM performance on realistic tool-use tasks through the scalable MCPs. We followed the official MCP-Atlas evaluation configuration with a 100 tool-call budget, and with 32k max tokens per step. The final result is averaged over 3 runs.
- MCPMark-Verified is a human-verified edition of [MCPMark](https://mcpmark.ai/), a benchmark for evaluating MCP tool use across five real server environments — Notion, GitHub, Filesystem, Postgres, and Playwright. Each task has been re-checked by our team and the benchmark offical and will be open-sourced soon. We followed the official MCPMark evaluation configuration with a 100-step tool-call budget and 32k max tokens per step. The final result is averaged over 3 runs.

		Preserve Thinking
	

Kimi K2.7 Code forces `preserve_thinking` mode, which retains full reasoning content across multi-turn interactions and enhances performance in coding agent scenarios.

This feature is enabled by default and can't be disabled. The following example demonstrates how to call K2.7-Code API in `preserve_thinking` mode:

```
def chat_with_preserve_thinking(client: openai.OpenAI, model_name: str):
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Tell me three random numbers."
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "reasoning_content": "I'll start by listing five numbers: 473, 921, 235, 215, 222, and I'll tell you the first three.",
            # Some API (e.g. vLLM) may not support reasoning_content, you can try reasoning instead
            "content": "473, 921, 235"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What are the other two numbers you have in mind?"
        }
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        stream=False,
        max_tokens=4096,
    )
    # the assistant should mention 215 and 222 that appear in the prior reasoning content
    print(f"response: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning}")
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
