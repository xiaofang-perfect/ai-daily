**Capacity expansion for Mixture-of-Experts models during continued pre-training.**

Dwivedi et al.,

"Expert Upcycling: Shifting the Compute-Efficient Frontier of Mixture-of-Experts"(preprint).

Scaling laws show that MoE quality improves predictably with total expert count at fixed active computation, but training large MoEs from scratch is expensive — memory, gradients, and all-to-all communication all scale with total parameters. Expert upcycling sidesteps this by starting training with a smaller E-expert model and expanding to mE experts mid-training via the upcycling operator:

**Expert replication**— each expert is duplicated (high-utility experts receive more copies via gradient-based importance scores).**Router extension**— router weights are copied to new slots with small bias perturbations to seed routing diversity.**Continued pre-training (CPT)**— stochastic gradient diversity and loss-free load balancing break symmetry among duplicates, driving specialization.

Top-K routing is held fixed throughout, so per-token inference cost is unchanged.

*Figure 1: Overview of the expert upcycling procedure.*

**Key results** on a 7B→13B total parameter (1B active) interleaved MoE, pre-trained on 380B tokens:

- The upcycled model (32→64 experts) matches the fixed-size 64-expert baseline across 11 downstream benchmarks (56.4 vs. 56.7 avg accuracy) and validation loss (1.263 vs. 1.267).
- Training cost is reduced by
**~32% of GPU hours**(27,888 vs. 41,328 hours). When a pre-trained checkpoint already exists (e.g., from a prior training run or a public release), the pre-training cost is already paid and only the CPT phase is needed, bringing savings to**~67%**. - Results generalize to full MoE architectures (256→512 experts, TopK=8) with 93–95% gap closure across scales from 154M to 1B total parameters.

Start from the official NeMo container — PyTorch, Megatron-LM, Transformer Engine, NeMo, Lightning, and omegaconf are all pre-installed.

```
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
-v /path/to/expert-upcycling:/workspace/expert-upcycling \
-it nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.09 bash
# Inside the container:
cd /workspace/expert-upcycling
pip install -e .
pip install dacite
```


Do notuse`pip install -e ".[nemo]"`

inside the container — it would conflict with the container's pre-installed NeMo.

Install dependencies manually, then install the package with the relevant extras:

```
# Core only (torch + numpy):
pip install -e .
pip install dacite
# With Megatron-LM integration:
pip install -e ".[megatron]"
# Full NeMo entrypoint (installs NeMo, Lightning, omegaconf):
pip install -e ".[nemo]"
```

Edit `configs/upcycle.yaml`

to set your model dimensions, then run from the repo root:

```
# Single GPU
cd /workspace/expert-upcycling
python -m expert_upcycling.entrypoint \
--config-path=configs --config-name=upcycle \
resume.restore_config.path=/path/to/base/checkpoint
# Multi-GPU (e.g. 8 GPUs with tensor parallelism)
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 -m expert_upcycling.entrypoint \
--config-path=configs --config-name=upcycle \
resume.restore_config.path=/path/to/base/checkpoint \
strategy.tensor_model_parallel_size=8
```

The callback fires on the first optimizer step, doubles the expert count, saves the upcycled checkpoint, and exits. The output path defaults to `<input_checkpoint>-upcycled`

.

```
import expert_upcycling
expert_upcycling.apply_patches()
# Now TEGroupedMLP has .upcycle_experts() and TopKRouter has .upcycle_router()
# Call them during training at the desired transition point.
# Note: model is typically wrapped — unwrap to reach the decoder:
inner = model
for attr in ("module", "module"):
if hasattr(inner, attr):
inner = getattr(inner, attr)
for i, layer in enumerate(inner.decoder.layers):
if hasattr(layer.mlp, 'experts'):
selected = layer.mlp.experts.upcycle_experts(optimizer, i, expert_cfg)
if hasattr(layer.mlp, 'router'):
layer.mlp.router.upcycle_router(router_cfg, selected)
```

```
from expert_upcycling import perform_expert_upcycling

model, optimizer,
expert_cfg={"usefulness_metric": "gradient_norm", "selection_strategy": "greedy"},
router_cfg={"method": "bias_only", "bias_noise_scale": 0.01},
)

This package treats Megatron-LM and NeMo as **third-party dependencies** — no fork required. Upcycling methods are injected at runtime via monkey-patching:
