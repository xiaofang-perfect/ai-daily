## Summary

I found an aggregate pattern in Codex `token_count` metadata: `gpt-5.5` responses disproportionately land at exactly `reasoning_output_tokens = 516`, with additional fixed-boundary spikes around `1034` and `1552`.

This appears model-specific and coincides with lower overall reasoning-token intensity, which may help explain degraded performance on complex/high-stakes Codex tasks.

This is related to [#29353](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/29353), which reported a task-level reproduction where `gpt-5.5` runs ending at exactly 516 reasoning tokens returned the wrong answer. This issue adds aggregate evidence across a larger Feb-Jun window.

I am not claiming this proves hidden chain-of-thought truncation. The narrower claim is that Codex telemetry shows a GPT-5.5-specific fixed-token clustering anomaly that looks consistent with thresholded reasoning-budget behavior.

## Environment

## Evidence

| Metric | Value | 
| Response-level token records analyzed | 390,195 | 
| Sessions represented | 865 | 
| Exact `reasoning_output_tokens = 516`events | 3,363 | 
| GPT-5.5 share of all responses | 19.3% | 
| GPT-5.5 share of exact-516 events | 82.0% | 
| GPT-5.5 exact-516 / >=516 ratio | 44.0% | 
| Non-GPT-5.5 exact-516 / >=516 ratio | 1.3% | 

Model-level result:

| Model | Response records | Exact 516 / >=516 | 
| `gpt-5.5` | 75,401 | 44.0% | 
| `gpt-5.4` | 25,214 | 19.8% | 
| `gpt-5.2` | 247,575 | 0.34% | 
| `gpt-5.3-codex` | 13,333 | 0.0% | 
| `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | 26,179 | 0.0% | 

Monthly exact-516 clustering increased sharply:

| Month | Exact 516 / >=516 | 
| Feb 2026 | 0.11% | 
| Mar 2026 | 2.45% | 
| Apr 2026 | 4.25% | 
| May 2026 | 53.30% | 
| Jun 2026 | 35.84% | 

At the same time, overall reasoning-token intensity decreased:

| Month | Mean reasoning tokens | P90 reasoning tokens | 
| Feb 2026 | 268.1 | 772 | 
| Mar 2026 | 256.8 | 723 | 
| Apr 2026 | 228.7 | 669 | 
| May 2026 | 106.9 | 344 | 
| Jun 2026 | 168.5 | 515 | 

## Why this looks suspicious

The anomaly is not simply higher reasoning-token usage overall. Mean and P90 reasoning-token intensity fell from February-April to May-June, while exact-516 clustering rose sharply.

The clustering is also not evenly distributed across models. `gpt-5.5` accounts for only 19.3% of responses but 82.0% of exact-516 events. Its exact-516 / >=516 ratio is about 33.6x higher than the non-GPT-5.5 baseline.

The fixed values are also notable: `516`, `1034`, and `1552` look like repeated threshold boundaries rather than a naturally varying reasoning-token distribution.

## Expected behavior

Reasoning-token counts for complex Codex tasks should vary naturally with task complexity and should not disproportionately cluster at exact fixed values for one model family.

## Actual behavior

`gpt-5.5` responses cluster heavily at exactly 516 reasoning tokens, with related spikes around 1034 and 1552. This pattern is much weaker or absent in several other models.

## Ask

Could the Codex team investigate whether `gpt-5.5` has a reasoning-budget, routing, truncation, fallback, or scheduler behavior that causes responses to terminate around 516/1034/1552 reasoning tokens?

If this is expected behavior, it would be useful to know whether exact 516 indicates a normal stopping point, a budget cap, a degraded tier, or another internal threshold.

Useful internal validation checks:

- Query `token_count`events with`reasoning_output_tokens`by model.
- Compare exact-value counts for `0`,`516`,`1034`, and`1552`.
- Compute `count(reasoning_output_tokens = 516) / count(reasoning_output_tokens >= 516)`by model and day.
- Compare `gpt-5.5`against`gpt-5.2`,`gpt-5.4`, and Codex-specific variants.
- Replay matched complex tasks across GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.5 with quality evals, especially separating exact-516 responses from longer-reasoning responses.
